Newton Group Transfers,"I really liked the professionalism of Newton Group's reps and how thorough they were from the registration of the timeshare, using the website, and making sure I have the documentation they needed. They continued giving me updates regarding the status of the timeshare process and the contact person was very friendly up until the end. I grew to trust her and I became very familiar with her in terms of her efforts, expertise and success with the company. The Newton Group and DC Capital Law worked together with me until the final resolution. The process was too long but not because of Newton Group or DC Capital Law, but because Harborside being an island community and really recalcitrant in wanting to let go of the timeshare or getting me out of it. I would also tell others to go with Newton Group. Many timeshare companies have called me but I would trust Newton Group and their professionalism. | I reached out to Newton because I needed to get rid of this timeshare. They presented me with a plan that I could afford and worked. They took all the information and I paid them upfront for part of it, and they worked with the timeshare company, and they kept me informed of the steps they were taking. In the end, it was all done. Every time I called them, I got to talk to somebody. If I didn't, they called me within a reasonable amount of time. It took a little longer than I thought it would, but it wasn't really an issue. It was 10 months. They said they couldn't tell exactly how long it would take, but it would take a while. So, I expected it. I would highly recommend them. | I had a really good experience with Newton. They were able to get us out of our timeshare. They sent us paperwork and we looked it over and signed it. It took a while to get the transfer done, but they accomplished it. They were very transparent in what fees we would need to pay. Everything they said was accurate. I would definitely recommend them if somebody was trying to not own a timeshare any longer. The only thing I would complain about was I had to email the contact person to find out what the status was. Maybe they should every three months, contact the customer and let them know, ""We're still working on it. It's still not through. We haven't forgotten about ya."" | After researching various time-share release companies and talking to one or two other ones, Newton Group stood out with the integrity. There was also the fact that they said they will get us out of this predicament. It may take time, which it did and it was two years, but it was a good experience with them all the way around. They referred us over to their team of lawyers who took it from there. We knew they would get the job done for us. The cost was just the one fee that we paid upfront for everything. We had great peace of mind. The agents were all very professional and cordial. They listened, they took all our information, and they did the work by going back and forth with our previous resort. We went through a few lawyers with the law firm but that might be natural. Each one picked up right where the other left off. They were great.
                                    More | Working with them took a while but they told me it would. It wasn’t that easy and I did it right during the middle of COVID so it made it even longer. But they were very helpful and they did what they said they were going to. Also, if I were to call, my personal lawyer would call me right back within a couple of hours. | When I had the appointment with Charles, I felt that he was very honest. I felt very comfortable talking to him. They did an excellent job. I really appreciated it and I'm thankful for it. It took well over 18 months. I was thinking that it would be a lot less than that, but I'm satisfied. | The rep we worked with was very intelligent. He was supportive and he explained everything to us upfront that we felt we needed to know. | We investigated several other companies and Newton seemed to fit the bill a little bit better. The rep I worked with kept me well informed throughout the process, which was about three months. | It was a slow process, which I understood because I knew it wasn't going to be an overnight process. They did call every month. They scheduled calls to keep me updated and I was completely satisfied. They were fantastic. | Working with Newton was really easy. They made sure to follow up on things. I just had really good communication on what needed to be provided. But I talked to some lady and she had a little tiny bit of an attitude. She said, ""You have 10 days to get this done."" I just didn't like that part. I got mad and hung up. But other than that, it was fine. I would recommend Newton.",4.8 out of 5
SellMyTimeshareNow,"We were hesitant about timeshare sales companies hearing bad reviews. We were happy with SMTS as they listed our unit and had pictures on the site. Any inquiries we were contacted. The sale went smooth and was all done through email. | Our experience with SMTN was great, with solid responsiveness and great customer service all throughout the process. We were treated with the utmost care and we felt valued as a customer. Highly recommended for those buying or selling a timeshare, I wouldn't go with another timeshare company. | We used Sellmytimeshare to purchase our timeshare in Ft. Lauderdale Beach Resort at a fraction of the cost of buying through the resort. Communication between our sales rep and the rest of the team was amazing. The process took a while as deed needed to be filed and confirmed, yet through every step they communicated and relaxed any fears we had due to many horror stories you read. We highly recommend SMTN, and will look to use them again. | I have had the pleasure of using this company multiple times to purchase resale Timeshares at the Garza Blanca resort in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Because I couldn’t afford the full price directly from the resort, I began searching for sellers online. That’s when I came across the SMTN company. Despite my initial skepticism, they proved to be trustworthy and reliable through their prompt and thorough communication. From the moment I left a message, they promptly reached out to me and guided me through the entire process, from speaking with their agent to the financial representative. Everything went smoothly, and I obtained my first Timeshare.
                                    More | I've read a lot of reviews of SMTN with varying experiences. My experience was a good one. I won't say my experience selling my timeshares was anything but frustrating, but it wasn't SMTN's fault. Most of my hassles were due to Marriott exercising right of first refusal and the extremely lengthy process of the entire ordeal (over 8 months). SMTN sold 3 of my timeshares in all. All 3 times, I was approached by them with a buyer without having to put out ANY money in advance. I know they also have a program to advertise your timeshare in advance of having a buyer, but I did not need to do this, so my experience was a better one. NO I did not get anywhere close to what I paid for them, but we got many many wonderful years use out of them, so we were ok with letting them go for less. I would use them again, but I won't have to! They sold all of mine. I would recommend them to a friend though! | We entered into this contract eyes wide open. We knew the resale market was a tough one and did not expect to make much at all. We just wanted out and this company was the one we chose. We paid one fee and out timeshare stayed up for over 3 years (through covid). Hilton also had our Hilton timeshare listed, but of course, showed no interest in really helping us. SMTN made any changes I requested to our listing. Got an offer and proceeded forward. Everything happened online except for one document that had to be notarized and mailed back to the mortgage company. DO NOT expect to make your investment back. Timeshares are not really an investment, they are a liability. SMTN are not realtors, they are brokers. They list your property in a market where timeshares owners can buy to increase their points values for a much cheaper price then the timeshares themselves offer. We are so happy to be out of our timeshare. | My husband and I are extremely detail oriented and have high expectations. While we needed to work out a few snags at the beginning, thanks to **, at SMTN, our Grand Timber Lodge (GTL) weeklong winter biennial purchase in Breckenridge finally closed. It took about four months. We ended up being okay with the length of time, because we love GTL and our cost was very low. ** was very conscientious and followed through on everything we needed. I wish we had worked with her from the start. 
                                    More | My husband and I sold our timeshare in Duck NC through SMTN. We had been warned by other people that this was going to be next to impossible. I’m happy to say we did sell it, and SMTN made the whole process painless. They reach a very large consumer base, and this worked to our advantage. | The people we interfaced with at SMTN were very informative about the process and what to expect. They responded very quickly to any of our questions in a professional manner. We were kept informed of the progress of the transaction and the whole process was in less time than I expected. I would highly recommend them if you are purchasing a timeshare resale. | From the day we started our purchase of a Platinum Hilton Grand Vacation Flamingo 2br unit to close was less than 2 months. Communication was great the whole time, though I would have liked an email afterwards letting need know that Hilton would NOT be reaching out to me. Otherwise was a great experience. | We recently purchased a one-week timeshare on Maui, and the experience was excellent. Our interaction with Zach from SMTN was incredibly professional - and on top of ensuring a seamless process, he earned our trust. We were extremely satisfied - and if we ever want to purchase a timeshare again, we'll use SMTN. | No problems in any part of the transaction. Always available for any questions I had. Very happy with their service. Very responsive and thoroughly explained each step of the process as we went along until completion and then still reached out to make sure all went well. I can’t say enough good things about the company.",4.7 out of 5
Royal Holiday,"They went over with me one claim at a time and sent me email documentation of what was discussed. But I'm still waiting if  they can get me out of the timeshare. All I want is my name off of it so I don't have to pay the taxes because I can't use it. I liked the way they talked to me and got back to me when I had questions. I also liked the way they helped me get things done. I'm happy with the experience so far. Talk to them and see what they can do for you. | Once I contacted Consumer Consulting Group and they told me there was that one fee and I would get the deed back, the timeshare people would take the deed back. We still had quite a bit of a balance. Consumer Consulting Group did what they said they were going to do and did it on time and that ends the story with the timeshare. It was a huge relief. They had me send them the information on the agreement that they had assigned during that hoopla, ""This is what you're gonna get."" They said there was a loophole in there that they didn't disclose certain entities or facts about the upgrade and transfer. They found those loopholes and entities that they did not disclose, and then they served a summons on the mortgage company and, as a result of that, the lending company honored the deed back. | I tried to call an old company that was working with me that went defunct and somehow that number came up and I got a certain Marc's number. He was with Consumer Consulting. We talked and I felt that they would protect me and help me get through my problem. We discussed what they would do and the fee and I agreed to it. They would be contacting the company that I was having a problem with and that they would take care of things. At this point, I'm not receiving any materials or any kind of information from the company that I was having a problem with. We're on the tail end of this thing. The only negative is sometimes Mark would not return calls. Also, sometimes if there's a certain person that I want to talk to and I ask for a callback, Consumer Consulting is lacking on that end. That's something that could be improved. | The reps at Consumer Consulting are very good. Their communication is okay. I had to call a couple of times but otherwise, they did well. I'd like to see a little more results a lot faster but I know that it takes time. They sent the timeshare people a letter and I have not heard anything from the timeshare other than they want money. | The rep from Consumer Consulting Group was very nice, giving me the information. And when I asked him questions, he answered it. I felt very secure because nowadays, you don't know who's telling the truth and who's not. First, he told me he has to see if we qualify and that they don't take all of the cases. He explained everything. So I felt comfortable and we decided to do it. He was very helpful and took his time because I was asking so much questions. It’s nice that you can talk to someone when you go into a situation and you don't know what to do or you don't know what’s gonna happen. You know that even though you're going through a situation, there's always a way out, but you just have to know how to do it and do the process. The experience with Consumer Consulting Group was amazing, pleasant, reliable and exceptional. | They auto charge after you cancel. They have a weird way to swindle more money out you when you cancel. The rep keeps talking like a robot tryna get you to stay and ignores your problem. 0 stars. Don’t put your card on file. Unhelpful is an understatement. | Consumer Consulting let me know everything that was gonna happen. My initial experience was good and the paperwork was easy. They told me they could get things done. They told me not to pay anymore, and they froze my credit. The only thing is my wife's credit is getting messed up as well. I called a little while ago to try to get that resolved, too. I thought the timeshare was just under my name, and it’s under both of our names. So right now, my credit dropped, and her credit dropped. They brought mine back up but they still haven't brought hers back up. So, her credit dropped about 200 points. | Consumer Consulting told me that they can handle any company and they had 90 percent success rate. Whoever called me told me that if they don't resolve my issue within a certain period of time, I'll get my money back. But it's been more than that already and my issue hasn't been resolved. It's been two years now, and I'm still receiving letters for the timeshare. I don't know what's really going on. I called Consumer Consulting and they told me, ""Yeah, I spoke to my manager and they'll give you a call back."" But they never called me back. 
                                    More | Most of Consumer Consulting's reps were pretty good. The first guy I worked with seemed to know what was going on. They had to check and see what was going on. There was nothing going on. For a long time, nothing went on. Finally, towards the end, I worked with Tikki. I especially liked her. She was really good about keeping me up on things. Overall, I knew they were gonna finish the process, but I just didn't think it would take that long. Sometimes, things take longer than others because of the non-cooperative group of people you're dealing with. | The process has not been going well. We gave them money two and a half years ago and we're still getting calls from the timeshares that they were supposed to be helping us get out of. I've had some collections and I'm constantly having to contact them to fix all of that. We have not been happy. They took our money and as far as we know, they have not done anything. They do not contact us or let us know what's going on.",3.8 out of 5
Consumer Consulting Group,"The man with the madrid tattoo at Riviera Maya is the most disgusting human being to ever walk the face of this earth. Anything they say like free credit etc ""you'll get it tomorrow,"" YOU WON'T. Absolute trash scammers, pathetic. | Thus far, the sweeteners are non-existent. We have renamed Club Freedom, Club Fraud. It still owes us $700+ after giving us a lesser quality room that we cancelled. Hotels and cars it offers often are more expensive than going to Expedia or Avis. And the $3,000 cruise credit is a total hoax. All Club Fraud offers is the wholesale price which only save a few hundred dollars. The executive homes and discounted first class air also a no go. All are resellers that you can get for free online. The Vidanta rooms always seem to be fully booked and you have to take them for a full week, Saturday to Saturday. Spend your money elsewhere. | I and my boyfriend took the Royal Caribbean and the ship stop at Puerto Vallarta. We entered a mall near the port and someone introduce the Vida says only one hour tour and free taxi then we can get really cheap travel packages. When we arrived there, sales spent nearly 4 hours to try to take money from our pocket. They said it's not timeshare and it is new member package. You will get 70% off of the vida vacation nights and 30-70%off for all luxury hotels for unlimited nights. Besides that, you will get 299 per week deal. The member fee initially is around 18000 and they cut it to 10000, then 6900... 
                                    More | May 2023 my husband and I took a day Excursion through Vallarta Adventures which is something we got from a different timeshare presentation. Upon returning to the cruise terminal port on our way out to try to get a taxi, there was people inside at stand which didn't appear initially to try to sell you a timeshare tour, but evidently they were trying to get you to go to a timeshare presentation. I almost got us through it and we talked for quite a bit with the gentleman and we know that we didn't want to go to any but in the end my husband wanted the free breakfast so we ended up getting suckered into it. We were promised a breakfast and then a 60 Minute tour that was going to be on a elongated golf cart golf cart type vehicle which held several people. 
                                    More | We attended a Vida Vacations presentation with a friend. We purchased a package and later changed our minds after reading the negative reviews on this site. The next morning, we emailed the company stating our wish to cancel our purchase. Profeco, the consumer protection agency of the Mexican government allows one to cancel a purchase within five days to get a refund. The Membership Services department of the company called us shortly thereafter and asked if we could return to the resort and gave us an appointment to see a representative. Our concerns were met with kindness and respect, and we were able to cancel without a great deal of difficulty. | Please not attend the presentation with Vidanta or Vida Vacations because my last presentation was November 1, 2022 and was terrible. The promises before sign are wonderful, after sign the contract changed everything and the service is terrible. My opinion is avoid the Vidanta's trap, please not accept the invitation at Vidanta's presentation or Vida Vacation Club!!! | Checking in: Get a receipt for resort fee, keep with passport, they will dispute payment on checkout.  
                                    More | It began with a sales presentation from Vidanta Resort of Puerto Vallarta. They include offers sounding too good to be true, well we are finding out the hard way that NOTHING so far has come into fruition. We had 2 offers we wanted to take advantage of--- cruise and flight 75/each. Well these ended up being scams and the ""companies"" that Vidanta works with, have no choice but to lie and be in the middle of the scams. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING A PURCHASE OF THEIR VACATION WEEKS, WELL STAY AWAY. Estella from Grand Incentives who seems to be accommodating and helpful, may be stuck in the middle of Vidanta's scam. We should have known better by reading the countless reviews on this scam. | My new wife and I decided to honeymoon in Cancun and chose a week I had (via an unrelated travel club) at a place called Mayan Palace, one of several Vidanta locations in Mexico. In short, our first 36 hours or so was a nightmare and very much in line with an article we read later describing how people are ""taken hostage"" who visit these places.
                                    More | I would like to add our experience to the reviews we read about on this site. I can attest that what we experienced was pretty much the same of the many previous reviews posted, except we did not buy, fortunately. The property is a beautiful 3000 acre Jurassic Park like resort. I would love to be able to stay at such a fine place, but after our experience, I dare not.

Vida Vacations,"I was booking a hotel in the Gatlinburg area when I came across some great online pricing. It said ""Call to book your stay"" so I did and that's when they started asking if I would be interested in buying into vacation homes and being able to stay at one of the many Westgate locations when I travel. I thought it seemed a little like a sales pitch but I agreed that a 90 minute tour of the Westgate Resort with a free lunch wasn't much to ask in exchange for a 50% discount on my hotel stay at a different location. They called me the day of the tour to ask if I minded coming for 1 instead of 2:30 because there was a cancellation. I thought this would be a great way to get that out the way and continue our vacation. Big mistake!
                                    More | Westgate Lake Resort & Spa. I have been a westgate lake resort’s owner for the past 15 years. Unfortunately I have been going through a financial hardship for the past two years that unfortunately has prevented me from paying the maintenance and tax fees. I am finally recovering and decided to contact them to discuss about payment options. I called them twice today and spoke with two different people but I wasn’t going anywhere with neither one. So I requested to speak with a manager. 
                                    More | Most of the Westgate properties themselves are reliably beautifully maintained; however, they will assign a “concierge” to you whose job is to harass you into making a timeshare purchase. We have been “owners” since 2007 and have gotten good at avoiding them. This time our unit was full of ants and we had to switch rooms. The concierge said, “I am so sorry, let me make it up to you. Let me get you lunch and I’ll give you a $100 voucher.” I specifically said I absolutely don’t want to go to a timeshare presentation, if that’s what this is I don’t want to do it. She assured me it wasn’t, she wanted to show me updates on the westgate company, say sorry about the ants and wouldn’t try to sell me anything. She lied, it was 2.5 hr presentation trying to bully me into upgrading. It ruins the whole vacation. I can’t believe I let her trick me into it. Ugh | After a super busy time in our professional lives, my husband and I decided to come to the Westgate Vacation Villas in Kissimmee. Please do not waste your time, money, or sanity by staying here. This has been the worst vacation ever. The villa is filthy, bugs crawling around, the entrance is heavily littered. It took me complaining to get someone to pick up the trash. Oh, I forgot to mention that I am an owner. However, I will never be active in their referral program. Buyers beware! | Our family has been going to Westgate for years now (we live in Florida). We got our week at Vacation Villas nearly 6 years ago now. Spend every summer there and can't say enough about it. Love the people and the place - great food too! Really nice place. | We have tried working with Westgate, the Better Business Bureau and we just keep getting the runaround. We are reaching out to your company with the same complaints that we have brought to others. There has to be someone that can help us as Westgate does not care about violating rights of our noblemen and woman of the armed forces. Westgate’s contract violated my rights under the Military Lending Law. Westgate contract forces me to voluntarily waive my rights to a jury trial! According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau:
                                    More | I was scammed by Westgate Town Center, and made to believe that I was going into a real estate investment by one of their so called agent. Unknown to me that it was all lies. I managed to make payments for over 30 months, until I realized that I was just being ripped off. I made attempt to go to Westgate Town Center in person with my wife to file the complaint, rather, they tried to lure us into signing and going into another contract to make us pay more. I have been depressed and needs help in getting away from this scammers, who tried to continue to extort me. | If there was an option for a zero star I would. I had the WORST experience ever with a hotel, I live almost 4 hours away. I found out we were having a long weekend because of Presidents' Day and decided to head to Orlando for some Universal Studios fun for the kids and family and booked a three day stay at this hotel. I first saw this hotel on Expedia and also some family member have a time shares and I visited last year for a day with them as a guest and saw their water park and hotel, I wasn't too sold on booking here but since I had been here last year I gave it a try. I opted specifically NOT to book through Expedia and instead I went directly to their website thinking it would be safer and no way were they going to screw up my reservation... Boy was I wrong! Anyway, I booked the hotel and got a confirmation email with a confirmation # and a receipt showing itinerary # (see picture).
                                    More | We booked a night at the wrong location by accident while evacuating from Hurricane Ian. We cancelled the reservation within minutes. They refuse to refund our stay, bouncing us between Corporate and the Front Desk, both telling us we have to call the other to get a refund. We travel often and have never had this issue with other companies. Stay away. They just want your money. It's ridiculous to watch ""The Queen of Versailles"" show and hear the owners of the company brag about their million dollar skylight, 10k bird, priceless antiques, etc. How they sleep at night taking money for services that we never receive is beyond me. 135.00 is nothing to this company. It meant everything to us. | Have been LIED to multiple times from 80-90% of their employees. Every presentation we have attended ended up being a seminar on lying. The Resorts are pretty nice but our Maint. Fees are getting OUT OF CONTROL. WG Cruise & Travel is a BIGGER scam than the resorts though. DO NOT book anything with WGCT as it is a nightmare and extremely aggravating. We were asked to upgrade to get free resort and cruise certs and did it. Lol, Resort dates are never available when we want to use them, hotels are usually cheaper on Expedia, and HOLY FREAKING COW what a nightmare trying to schedule a cruise. Just for giggles went out to EXPEDIA and again FOUND CHEAPER PRICES. This is started to become slightly comical to me now but it still very upsetting. We work hard for our money and wished we would have found a more honest company to do business with.",1.3 out of 5
Bluegreen Corp.,"Beware of the nightmare that awaits you at Blue Green Vacations Resort Mountain Run. My recent stay at this establishment was nothing short of a harrowing experience, and it is my duty to warn others about the horrors I encountered. Right from the start, their deceitful tactics were evident. They lured me in with the promise of a gift card if I attended a supposedly brief 60-to-90-minute presentation. Little did I know that this was just the beginning of their manipulative schemes.
                                    More | I write this with a heavy heart as I recount the experience my wife and I had with the Bluegreen Vacation Club on February 21, 2023, in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. To say that we were disappointed and frustrated would be an understatement. We thought we were attending a simple meeting to get updated information on changes in our Diamond Status, and how to move higher on the calling list to book resorts. Instead, we were coerced into signing a timeshare contract that left us in financial ruin. 
                                    More | I sent a letter to the Bluegreen Executive offices requesting the release from my heinous contract. They lied to get me to sign and all they told me is to “reach out to our mortgage settlement department…to see if I qualify for a possible settlement to exit the contract.” And if that was not to my liking, they offered me 3 other options that only apply if I pay off the mortgage in full. I have already paid close to $10,000, and I am not giving you anymore money. Do the right thing, cancel the contract, and don’t lie to me anymore. To the public at large, it is imperative you don’t do business with Bluegreen or else you’ll wind up just like me! | For the past few months now, we have been in contact with your Bluegreen Corporate office to see what can be done to cancel our timeshare that we ""own"". At first we were just being ignored, they were only reaching out about our past due balance, and then we started getting letters from a company called Cohn & Dussi trying to collect payments from us. With about 2 months ago, we finally spoke with someone from corporate over the phone. Her name was Keshia and she basically confirmed our information for verification purposes and then told us that she could not and would not offer us any type of cancellation. 
                                    More | We want to urgently warn others about our desperate situation as Bluegreen timeshare owners. Our experience has been filled with deceit and disappointment from the initial phone call promising a ""free"" trip to Pigeon Forge to the relentless high-pressure sales presentation. We were lured into a lengthy sales presentation that felt like a psychological trap. Despite declining multiple times, we were relentlessly pursued and manipulated until we reluctantly gave in and purchased the silver package. Our dreams of enjoyable family vacations quickly turned into a never-ending nightmare. Bluegreen failed to deliver on promises of flexibility and convenience, leaving us frustrated and disappointed. Attempts to find answers at a ""How to Use and Book"" meeting only led to more deceptive sales tactics and pressure to purchase more points. 
                                    More | I was lied to by Bluegreen Resorts and coerced into signing a contract with them. They Promised me the sales price of the timeshare was $12,600, but they obscured the fact that with the ridiculous interest rate, I will be paying $13,700 in FINANCE CHARGES alone. This has more than doubled my purchase and I can't believe they pulled one over on me. Especially considering in the year I've owned the timeshare, I have not been able to take a single vacation But Bluegreen doesn't mind continuing to take my money every month. Because of this, at 70 years old, I am forced into working for Door Dash to make ends meet.
                                    More | My husband and I were approached at the Bass Pro store in Oklahoma City to purchase a 2-night stay in Branson for $179. He asked us if we had ever stayed at the Big Cedar Lodge in Branson and told him we actually had several years ago. We thought this would be a great weekend for our upcoming anniversary. The sales rep never mentioned that we wouldn't be staying at the Big Cedar Lodge. 
                                    More | Don't do it beware. Was told would be 2 hours more like over 3 hours and at least told them 6 times we didn't want it. Every time we said no we are good a new person would show up and would try to pressure you into buying and than the next person would get rude and so on. The sales guy Andrew had the worst customer service I have ever seen and said to us at one point if you are not going to buy this then why did you come? Really!!!

I was given a 1 year extension to my sampler package I purchased through a Bass Pro Shop deal because there are only 5 locations and black out dates and all of them were booked. Supervisor basically called me a liar and said there's nothing she can do and never even tried. She was rude and now I'm out a lot of money. This company is horrible to their clients! | We are unhappy with our contracts with Bluegreen Resorts and are trying to cancel them. After being pressured into buying their timeshares that we can't afford and don't want, we have tried to get out, but Bluegreen has ignored us. Salespeople used emotional tricks and made promises that weren't true to persuade us. Affordable and flexible travel is non-existent. Salespeople told us they were upgrading our original contract to “fix” issues, but they signed us up for a whole separate contract, loan, and maintenance fees. Now we are paying for 2 contracts and have even more issues. We still cannot rent the timeshare; we don’t have enough points to go where we want, and the availability is even worse than before. All we are doing is throwing money away on what can best be described as a scam and they refuse to acknowledge the deceptive ways their salespeople ensnared us into 2 contracts!",1.2 out of 5
Wyndham Vacation Resorts,"We just had the worst experience ever at a Wyndham Vacation sales center in Sevierville, TN, connected with Club Wyndham Smoky Mountains. No problems at all at the actual resort -- it is great and the people here have been wonderful. However, we were told to go to the ""informational presentation"" about all the changes that have occurred since Travel & Leisure was purchased. Long story short, we were not given detailed information about the new programs. Rather, we were lied to repeatedly and never got the questions we did have answered. They basically blamed us for not consolidating our existing contracts previously under Travel & Leisure, which did not even exist when we were last told about consolidating our contracts. At that time, they were going to charge us $40,000 to change our account, which we thought was ridiculous. 
                                    More | First we were approached at sign-in to go to presentation. Sales clerk said it was soft sell (laugh) and 90 min. but many times they can get it to 60 min. Easy, right? $200 cash and $100 dining certificate after presentation. OK we were skeptical, had no interest in ownership at all but they dangled the money. Now we've been to these before that were group presentation and truly not a hard sell. Well we would rather have a root canal than go through that again. It totally ruined the entire day, plus based on this, we will NEVER again stay in any Wyndham property. 
                                    More | I have been a member of Wyndham Club as a VIP Silver and decided to cancel my membership. I talked to a Certified Access agent and found out that the processing will take 10 to 12 weeks just for the exit application to be process and another 10 to 12 weeks for it to be approved. While waiting we have to pay the maintenance fee and she said that we can't use the points that are still remaining. When you sign for membership, it takes a day but when you decide to exit it take 24 weeks. Just plain wrong the how the exit process is and it should be changed. Members be aware. | Visited Wyndham in Greenville NC. We reserved 2 rooms for 1 night. Bed bugs found in first room so we move. Then we inspect other rooms and found them in there. Customer service hung up on me. Matt at the front desk told me there was nothing he could do. He called General Manager who refused to speak to me and lied saying he was out of town until Monday. Matt told me he was lying because he doesn't care and that he ""chuckled"" when he was told I wanted a refund. Cancelling my account with Wyndham and posting reviews on every site they advertise on. Never again will we stay at another Wyndham Hotel. | Our family has been Founder VIP owners with Club Wyndham for over 25 years. During COVID lockdowns my mother was diagnosed with aggressive dementia, which required around the clock care for over 2+ years until her death. We were unable to travel and spent the majority of our time caring for my mom. Since we couldn’t travel we used our complimentary guest pass (we are afforded 45 passes per year) to let friends and members of our church to use the resorts. They helped to mitigate our maintenance fees and were able to enjoy Wyndham resorts since we were unable to leave my mom.
                                    More | In 2015 we were not provided with the complete and accurate needed to make a knowledgeable business decision and purchase of points. On Aug 11, 2023 we found out that in 2015 the number of points needed to reach silver VIP status was 400K points. We were sold 126K points, only enough points to bring our account balance to 371K. We were not informed that the threshold was 400K points to reach silver VIP. Instead of offering us a 155K points package we were given bonus points to give us temporary VIP status for 2 years. We now believe this was done so that in future years they could approach us again to buy another large quantity of points. 
                                    More | They lied and misrepresented what we was buying and paying for and just a whole lot of unnecessary lies about the points and stays and salesman Josh in Tennessee didn’t do anything but lie to us the whole time. That was a waste of $18,000.00 they took from us. | I can't believe that this company is allowed to be publicly traded! Lies after lies when they try to sell you something. They will provide you dozens of papers with tiny details hidden between them and then they will rush you into signing those documents - you don't even get enough time to read through those dozens of papers. Once signed, that's when they will start finding ways to steal your money! That's the kind of SCAM business they are running. They stole about $4000 from us! I will never forget that! | If you want to throw away $5,000 and get absolutely nothing and then a customer service line that transfers you to a medical alert line and tells you that no one's available and transfer you to Spanish speaking lines and after 3 hours they tell you, ""I'm sorry your contract said that you could travel within 2 years"" and the two years we could have traveled was during Covid. I don't understand why they think it's okay to steal $5,000 from people. Worst company in the world. | I became an owner in September of 2022 while I was on vacation with my boyfriend and our kids. When we got there to check in, they asked us some questions. One of the questions was is anyone going through a divorce. I stated, ""Yes. Is that a problem?"" and she goes, ""No just make sure everything go under him if you guys decide to do it."" So that was in the back of my mind to address in presentation. During our sit-down talk with our rep Debbie, I had told her that I was in the middle of a divorce, so I didn’t want my name as the head of this loan multiple times. I also stated that I didn’t want another thing to worry about paying for at this moment and they told me multiple times that they understood and would still see what they could do for me.

RCI,"I will admit that buying a timeshare was a mistake, and using RCI to take advantage of that investment just made it worse. We were on the points system, and based on their catalog using our 75000 points should have resulted in several vacations a year. But in reality, we were never really able to use it because RCI would just tell us that everything we wanted was booked up. EVERY TIME. So points would expire or we would pay to extend the points, but we could never really use the points. Meanwhile if you called the resort you were trying to book with RCI, for the same time period, they would tell us that they have plenty of rooms available. So basically RCI just lies to you to keep you from using your points. TOTAL SCAM. | While I have owned a timeshare for more than 25 years, I have only had to use the RCI exchange/banking program twice (2020 and 2021 because of COVID). I have gone to the same location that I purchased for more than 20 years. I enjoy the space, my children enjoy the space. I own the largest unit (2 bedroom Presidential with lock-out). I banked 2020 and had to use it by 2022. When I made plans to use the unit, I was met with resistance from the RCI worker (Alex). He finally stopped trying to instruct me on visiting another location and 'allowed' me to book at Grand Palms where I own. I had to pay $395 to use my space (which I understood). A few weeks before travel I had surgery. Instead of losing my week, I convinced a family member to go. I had to pay another $300 for my sister to use the location. I seriously object to that additional fee.
                                    More | I'm not going to run on. This time-share company is a scam and I fell for it hook, line and sinker. I have been looking for over a year to find any decent vacation. Each time I check the rate without RCI and it's cheaper. I just booked a hotel using my points and with all the hotel fees for RCI members are paying more than if I booked using the hotel website. If you want to spend time in Hungary then there are plenty of deals. It cost me 8K to learn my lesson. | The exchange plus is ridiculous. If I wanted to stay in a hotel, I wouldn't have bought a timeshare. Almost every time I want to exchange my weeks, the choices are flooded with these outrageously priced hotels. If you want to run a hotel site make it separate. It doesn't even give me the option to not see these. I have owned a timeshare and been an RCI member for over 30 years. Every year it gets more expensive and offers less. | I used RCI Exchange to book a week stay. I called the resort prior to advise We would be checking in a day late. When we arrived the lobby had closed at 5 pm. There was a sign that stated if you are a late arrival to call a specific number and you would be given your room number and lock box code to retrieve your key. We called the number and did not receive a call back for 2 hours later. We sat outside on a golf cart from 5 am to 7:30am before someone called back. We enter our room and I immediately notice bugs on the table and in the bathroom. I took a shower and the tub is stopped up.
                                    More | If I could give this place a zero I would but I can’t so I’ll give it a one. Me and my husband have been members for years and it hasn’t been great but overall it’s been fine, until we went on vacation a couple weeks ago. We booked this condo well over a year in advance and when we got there we were informed RCI had cancelled it due to an “unpaid fee”. We were not informed of this fee and not one email was sent to us saying that our reservation was cancelled. We had more than enough points and it actually showed that we had a credit on said fee before we left. RCI wouldn’t do anything to help us and we ended up having to pay for a hotel with cash. | We've been timeshare members for almost 10 years and have had consistently bad experiences. The RCI reps cannot answer questions and it seems like there are frequently new fees. Our home resort was recently sold and decided to opt out of RCI - which no one at RCI could help me figure out. It took many phone calls to figure out what was going on. Again, terrible service. | I was looking at properties on RCI website and had questions regarding the room and pricing. I noticed that the rooms are higher in price on RCI website than it is dealing with the hotels directly and wanted to make sure I was looking at the right room. I called RCI several times and was hung up on twice. And when I am able to speak with a representative, I am immediately transferred to a different department that transfers me to another department that transfers me over to Hilton. But the property that I’m looking at is not a Hilton property even though my timeshare is with Hilton. 
                                    More | Terrible. This is a con. Every time I have used this service except one time has been a rough hotels. They hit you with fees all the time. The last place I walked out of has homeless people all out side the hotel. Feel bad for them. I should have given one of them the room. It’s looked beautiful online. They need to check the places they are pushing. I complained and they told me I didn’t do it soon enough. I got sick the day I got home and this is the first chance I had to ask for my money back. I got a BIG FAT NO. They don’t give a **. My hotel before that closed. The one before that hadn’t been upgraded since the 50s yellow and green Devore that my mother had, she would be 97. The first and only one was good. I will never use them again. They say you can get all these good trips good luck. They charge you every year but can only use my points every other year. It’s all **. | In 2022 my wife and I went on a 1 week trip to Las Vegas. We belong to Wyndham but had o go through RCI since we banked our points during covid. When we got to the timeshare they said since we only booked for 6 days and not seven there would be a additional fee??? They ended up waiving the fee because it wasn't told to us at time of booking. We said we would have just stayed the extra day. It made no sense. Anyways on to the timeshare itself. At first look, room was nice however after 2nd night of stay my wife noticed bites all over my back.

WorldMark TravelShare,"They will mislead and outright lie to get you to their presentations. The salesmen are VERY good so BEWARE! You can get better deals, better proximity, availability and often even nicer places on vrbo etc DO NOT BUY THIS!!! They will tell you you can sell it back if you dont like it but thats NOT true! You should get a lawyer to help you read your contract before buying if you really think you want to- but they won’t even let you do that because they say you have to buy that day or the price goes up. | I am currently on the phone with customer service. Wow. Totally incompetent. I agree with everyone else. Customer service has gone way downhill. I have been dealing with an issue since 2021. I was told a supervisor would be put on the call. Nope. The rep came back on, and wanted to create a service ticket. Did I mention I've been dealing with the ""service ticket"" for over a year, and they haven't dealt with the original one yet? Back on hold waiting for the supervisor. Back on hold. The supervisor that I was told would be on the line, has now become a 24 minute wait. Back soon.
                                    More | I'm an authorized user on my parent's account. They added me as they are aging and not able to travel as easily anymore. They are end of life planning and wanted us to be able to utilize their timeshare (which they have had for decades) and they are platinum...which for the moment is their top tier, but the company will just add another tier and push for more money. My parents have spent tens of thousands of dollars already, not including monthly ""maintenance fees"". We've gone to the presentations, be prepared to spend a lot of time at the sales-pitch (not worth it, regardless of the ""gift""). My go-to plan is to tell them we're done & if they won't return our keys, they'll be warned about unlawful imprisonment. 
                                    More | They call it vacation ownership. But what they don't tell you is that you're signing a deed like it's a home purchase. This is far from the truth. But if you sign all these documents they've covered their bases to be able to collect any amount of money they can from you including all of the continued maintenance fee increases. We never upgraded the whole time we signed for this which was 6,000 credits. But they continued to raise our maintenance fees. If you pay their so called mortgage off they'll take it back to screw someone else into buying it. But they will never give you a dime for it. If you still owe on their so called mortgage you are obligated to pay because again you're signing a deed. That's where they're lying to people. 
                                    More | I read everyone’s reviews and I’m so glad we did not purchase. This Timeshare and its “gifts” were a joke. We were told it was a 120 minute presentation but we were there over 3 hours. I want my time back. I’ve never met more pushier sales people than the WorldMark staff. We were deceived and mislead into having our credit ran, which we were never told about until we got the letter in the mail. After consistently saying no we weren’t interested they kept coming at us with more numbers. It was a total waste of time. | We've been members for 25 years. This company is going downhill and does not care about customer experience, They only care about money. Recently they canceled a reservation WITH NO WARNING for my daughter's birthday because she was using two guest passes for the same dates. I spent two hours on the phone trying to fix the problem and they could do nothing to help me. They refused to compensate me in any way other than refunding a token for housekeeping. DO NOT BUY INTO THIS COMPANY. | Hadn't logged in to my Worldmark account in a long time so I was required to reactivate my account. This included setting up a new password and OTUP. Fine. I received a confirmation email with my user name and a link to activate. When I got to that page and entered my user name (provided by them) and password, there was a message that said there was a problem with my user name and to call their number. I did so and was on hold for 40 minutes before giving up. They simply don't answer their calls. The technical configuration of the website is no better than it was 5 years ago. This company really can't do anything right except milk people out of their money. | If I could rate the company lower I would. We were sold a trial to test out the timeshare under false pretenses and when we called to try and fix the situation they took months to figure out what they planned to do. We were told different stories from each person we talked with on their support team. When we purchased our contract we asked which locations it was available to be used at and wrote down the one that was most convenient for our family. 
                                    More | They are all a bunch of liars and we fell for it hook, line and sinker. Their customer service is horrible. We have been trying for 3 years to get some changes done. Don't fall for this company, they don't care about anything except the dollar. | We have been owners for 22 years. We started out with 6K (the minimum in 2001). We were given a book with phone numbers and sent on our way. While in San Diego, we decided we needed more points to be able to travel to other locations, so we upgraded and signed up for Travel Share (Silver Elite). After a few years, we decided to drop TS as a complete waste of our money. With 20K points we could go anywhere we wanted (and did), and we got our free wifi and a movie ticket. We never once used the movie tickets other than to give them to young families. We looked into going on a cruise, but that turned out to be way more expensive than going directly to the cruise line.

Welk Resort Group,"My husband and I got an offer for a free stay with Welk at Branson Lodges at Timber Ridge, but we had to sit through a presentation to qualify. Let me tell you, that presentation lasted for FOUR hours, and I can’t tell you who was more annoyed…us or our kids? The salesman was going on and on about all these great benefits, like how our investment value would go up and how easy it would be to use. He even said they would buy back the timeshare if we ever changed our minds. It turns out none of that was true and now we're stuck paying hundreds of dollars every month.
                                    More | Dear Consumer Affairs, I am writing to lodge a formal complaint against the Welk Resort Group, specifically regarding their Hyatt Vacation Club Platinum Program (Contract Number: #**). I fell prey to their high-pressure sales tactics, deceptive promises, and an overall stressful environment, including being separated from my child during the process. These circumstances led to my hasty decision to sign the contract. Since then, I have been trying unsuccessfully to cancel this contract. The situation has not only put me under significant financial stress but has also severely affected my credit score. This ordeal has been mentally taxing, and I feel trapped and deceived by the Welk Resort Group. I am seeking your assistance in investigating this matter and hope for a fair resolution. Please reach me at ** for any further information or documentation that you may need. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Eldar **. | Owning a real estate investment property with Welk Resort is a joke! Why you ask? Because it’s a TIMESHARE, not an investment property. Availability is scarce and when Hyatt took over, we felt there would be some hope after all. Nope…Hyatt is just as bad, if not worse. We were told we would receive a deed once this is paid off, which only reinforced the fact they were selling us a real estate investment. Another real estate investment queue was that we could rent out our unit for a profit, which in turn would help pay off the loan quicker. If you ever buy a timeshare, a house or any type of real estate, do not let the closing officer have you sign a contract off an iPad because they will skip over the most important financial details, and you won’t find out you’ve been screwed until it’s too late. | This was the worst purchase I have ever made. With no luck, I have tried and tried to reach someone at Welk to help me cancel my timeshare. I was taken advantage of and led to believe that I was purchasing something of value but in reality, it isn’t worth a dollar. It is becoming a financial strain and I keep putting money into it every month but never get anything in return.
                                    More | Sick and tired doesn’t even begin to describe how I feel about Welk. Since 2018, they have been a constant thorn in my side. I am currently on a mission to cancel my contract since Welk employees have done nothing but lie and manipulate me. The saleswoman I worked with should be fired! The 30 minute tour/presentation went on for hours. Every time I said NO to an offer, I was given a new “better” deal. The sales supervisor even took a shot at me personally by saying I was being “too cheap”. They told me things like - They would make maintenance fees due every other year instead of annually (that never happened).
                                    More | We have told all of our family and friends and will continue to spread the message here: DO NOT TRUST THOSE WELK RESORT EMPLOYEES! Their salespeople hooked my wife and I on a Reno trip back in 2017 with free show tickets. Mind you, at this time we already owned a timeshare we wanted to get rid of, so we knew we would say no and just get the free tickets. This backfired more than I could ever imagine. We spent about 3.5 to 4 hours declining their advances. That is just plain crazy! I was 67 and my wife was 60 at the time, why would they hold us hostage for that long? 
                                    More | They will rope you in with promises of a 60-minute commitment in exchange for “gifts”. First, they will give you a “survey” which does 2 things. First, it sets up their “pitch” and second, they will ask about where you work to assess your income. They take you on a tour, present this as an opportunity to be “key holders” and as such would have “first choice” of rooms on the property. This was followed by talking about what we could gain access to through RCI. RCI is owned by another company, it is where you “exchange”…This is how they sold us with the promise of going anywhere in the world.

It is so unfortunate that they have shown their true colors and it is not what I had hoped for. I was told they had access to Disney which was a big lie. How bad does a product and service must be for someone to blatantly lie about everything to get a sale. I really feel bad for Welk because they just seem like they cannot get it together. I have an idea, maybe instead of lying to your customers, you tell the truth. Then, more people can trust you and will have better things to say. | You’re on vacation but I’m the middle of nowhere and all their “attractions” are out of order. Your room is in disrepair, there is one roll of toilet paper and the toilet paper holder falls off the wall upon touching it. The folding hairdryer won’t stay open and there’s no shampoo, soap, etc. You “get to” cook all your own food and do your own laundry too! No one’s gonna come make your bed or tidy up! Just like home! There’s no Wi-Fi in the bedroom so forget reading the news in bed next to your sleeping spouse. Just like a crap motel! But that’s okay because the walls are paper thin and you can hear everyone on all sides of you at all times. Just like an apartment. And all this could have been ours for $16,000 upfront and then no less than $600 a year to start for the rest of our lives and our kid’s lives and our kid’s kid’s lives.

Because of Welk, I have now experienced these horrors firsthand. I was told I would have the ability to book amazing resorts across the world (including Disney), my timeshare could be inherited by my children, and I’d pay upfront cost for full suites rather than a hotel room, etc. They even went as far as telling me I was able to book using points through RCI to Disney’s Animal Kingdom (A MAJOR REASON WHY I PURCHASED). All these lies showed their true colors very soon after. Unacceptable. Everything I was told was a lie. I am disgusted with the way that Welk does business and I plan on letting the Attorney General know my firsthand experience with their deceptive sales practices.

Global Exchange Vacation Club,"This place is a huge scam. They bamboozled me at a water park with my kids and promised these fantastic Disney tickets.

Then I had to listen to this lady yammer for 35 minutes. The bottom line is you will be paying $12K plus $350 annual HOA fees and $500+ per trip without airway and if you don't go four weeks out of the year you have to pay large fees.

I called to be removed since I will not be able to use the account if I wanted to. I'm not the primary. Secondly when we initially signed up We were told it is not a timeshare, it’s a membership. We were told we could get hotels for the same price Priceline gets them for, they will fix the money. We fix the time. I set aside time for a family vacation and we couldn’t find anything. The price was cheaper than any other online search for travel which is a lie. They also said we could go anywhere in the world and near popular amusement parks.

All of this occurs within 30 days unless I pay extra money. Ironically, I never received any billing from them. My membership was totally paid up. Approximately $8,000 to be exact.

How is it useless you say? They sell you a fixed amount that they replenish every year - but you have to pay $157 to replenish it (after the initial $5000 buy in). Then you have to pay for an RCI membership ($99-$199 per year). Then you have to pay to use the points on RCI (about $300 per time) and you don't even have access to any good resorts - the amount of points they give you gets incrementally less valuable as RCI's points cost inflates every year.

Don’t waste any more time or money dealing with them. Worst than Enron and the Koch brothers combined with these types of tactics. | Updated on 4/28/2020: I called in today so that I could talk to an actual customer service person. Well I able to finally make contact to an individual, and his name was Derrick. I explain him my situation regarding no longer working or no longer could afford to pay for a time share I have never used. He was so rude that he told me that he didnt care there were a lot of people calling in saying the same thing.

Vacation Village Resorts,"We arrived at our presentation with Vacation Village, and I explained to them we couldn’t stay long because we had plans. They decided to not respect our time and kept us there for SIX hours. Being there for six hours was certainly not up to us. They pressured us and made us feel trapped, as every time we wanted to leave, they would continue to offer different “deals”. In the end we felt like we needed to upgrade/switch to points just to be able to leave. We felt a little bit of relief once learning from our sales associate that we were able to receive tax advantages. This, along with the other things we were sold on, were all lies. So, we ended up getting stuck in a contract that benefits us in no way.
                                    More | I have never been so dissatisfied with a company in my life. Vacation Village has really let me down and it is depressing. When I bought it, they explained I have property ownership and I could have access at any time at any location. I have not been able to schedule the use of any property in 7 years. For having a high interest rate, you would think I would be able to have access. (I was verbally told 8.99%, however when I reviewed the contract, it is 17.99%). They told me if I disliked it, I could sell my purchase back to them at any point. However, I am not able to sell it back, even after paying $26,000 for nothing. 
                                    More | Vacation Village Resorts is by far the biggest rip off!!! I don’t recommend anyone go here!!! Their staff is full of unprofessional people who lack integrity if it were tattooed on their individual bodies!!! Worst experience ever!!! Waste of my time!!!! They promised us one thing to get us to the presentation and at the end we didn't get what we was promised. Also the lady told us that he probably wouldn't be 90 mins, then the guy doing the presentation told us we had to stay for the entire 90 mins. Then another family next to us experienced the same thing. Just a bunch of lies!!! | I went to the timeshare tour since one of my friends referred me to go and learn more about the offer that he got himself. My fiance and I went there and everyone was extremely nice and used all of the possible marketing tactics in 5 min of talking. Nonetheless, we were genuinely interested in learning everything about it but we just couldn’t close the deal at the time. Once we got at the end at the closing stage, the nice lady suddenly became super aggressive and pushy with the offer. They tried everything to make us do it and we just said no. Then not even a “bye thank you” we got from the lady who spent more than 2hrs showing the place around. | Vacation Village is full of tricksters. When my wife and I went to the presentation, we were very clear about not wanting to buy and were focused on saving money and starting a family. Our salesman convinced us we would be investing in real estate and could earn extra income through rentals. He preyed on our desire to have a family without a financial struggle. There is no rental income, no real estate, nothing. What’s worse is we can’t even use the timeshare. Getting a reservation is ridiculously hard AND we see reservations online for the general public for FAR less than our payments. Save your money and book that way instead. Just don’t let them con you into a presentation, let alone one of their contracts! | I think the worst thing I ever did was buy a timeshare. Maybe all of them aren’t terrible, but Vacation Village/El Dorado Resorts has to be the absolute worst! You’d think a military vet would be treated with a bit more respect than I got. From the day I first signed up, I have dealt with nothing but lies about every aspect of this timeshare. For up to five hours, sales personnel dazzled me with the idea of exotic vacations to Spain and Portugal, but I can’t even book anything in the U.S., let alone internationally! Even so, I paid off the whole timeshare balance and still have to deal with rising maintenance costs, all for nothing!
                                    More | Vacation Village IS A SCAM! My late husband and I were conned into buying this timeshare, which was sold to us as a rental income producing unit that would pay for itself. We’ve been able to travel a few times, but we’ve never generated any profit, only debt. As I am in my twilight years, I start to think about my kids' lives once I’m gone and when I discovered that the timeshare will pass onto my kids I’ve been nauseous ever since. This timeshare is 100% paid off and Vacation Village will not take it back, even though they told us they would in the event that life changes.
                                    More | Me and my sister were on vacation in Vegas. We decided to go check out the timeshare. We decided to purchase it. We got back to the hotel and look over the paperwork. It's all bad people. Thank god we canceled the next day. Don’t do it people. | Late the night before we were to check out 12/22/2022 at Vacation Village in Weston FL, the man at the front desk, located across Weston in another building, gave our room key to a couple who body slammed our room door at 1AM in the morning to get it open with a key, because we had it latched from inside. They then entered our room and refused to leave until I picked up the phone to call the police. They scared us to death. The police told us to report it to the front desk to alert security and make sure these people would not be back. Well, the man at the front desk wouldn't answer the phone for well over an hour. He evidently had turned all calls over to a recorded advertisement which played over and over. So, if you have an emergency, no one will be able to help you other than calling the police.
                                    More | I did the Time Share tour with Pamela ** from Grandview Resorts (Vacation Village). She promised all sorts of options with the purchase of my Biannual Time share. She neglected to inform me that you have to book your home week 12-13 months in advance, if not you have to use your points and pay a fee. Well I bought in Oct and my week is in June!!! So now I have to pay to use the service, which should be free!! Also you can't book unless you join RCI for a FEE!!!! I informed her I was already a member of RCI but she failed to inform me I would have to join AGAIN and pay another FEE, for a group I was already a member!!! They (RCI) will not combine the membership, even though it is the same person (me) but different companies (Wyndham and Vacation Village).

Exploria Resorts,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the services provided by Exploria Resorts. My husband and I were misled about the affordability and benefits of owning a timeshare, and instead have been burdened with increasing maintenance fees and a lack of availability. The pushy salespeople pressured us into purchasing the timeshare, despite us declining all the offers thrown at us. After a couple of hours, we had enough and caved to an $8000 price. I wish the employees went over the contract with us because we would not have signed it if we had seen that it was really $13,862! When we got home and finally read the 28-page contract, we found out we got a 2-bedroom in East Stroudsburg, PA! We would not have spent so much if we knew that’s where we had to vacation.
                                    More | My encounter with Exploria Resorts was an absolute nightmare. It all began with a persuasive cold call promising a free vacation in Orlando, but there was a catch—I had to endure a never-ending 90-minute sales presentation. Little did I know it would turn into a grueling three-hour ordeal of false promises and intense pressure tactics. They painted a picture of affordable global travel through RCI, but it was all smoke and mirrors. Attempting to book vacations through RCI proved to be a futile exercise, and even when I managed to secure something, it was never my desired destination. The entire experience reeked of deception and left me burdened with hefty annual fees for a property that served no purpose. Despite my pleas, Exploria Resorts refused to release me from the contract, displaying a shocking lack of empathy. Trust me, steer clear of this company! | I sent and Exploria received a 2-page letter with detailed information regarding my presentation, and the mis-reps that took place, and they responded to it, with a basic, generic, boilerplate template. A measly 3 small paragraphs. They do not address the concerns you bring to their attention and are so unwilling to help you! I am no more than a dollar sign to them! They’ll ask you questions to establish rapport, and seem so charming, and they use what you tell them against you, and make you believe you’re getting this incredible offer, when in reality they’re setting you up to pay tens of thousands of dollars, for something you’ll quickly learn you cannot use how they described!
                                    More | We got our timeshare with Exploria 4 years ago and that’s when the stress and lies started. They were putting on a huge show, had us sit through their spiel for over 4 hours, and guaranteed us the world and then some. It was totally misleading. We said no and they wouldn’t let up or let us leave to make a decision, it had to be right then without any chance to actually look at any paperwork. The sales rep Fred said we would be able to travel whenever we wanted to and that our points would get us at least four vacations every two years. None of it was true. They gave us a free three night stay in a villa, which was gorgeous so we agreed. When we showed up for the stay this villa was disgusting. There were bugs all over the place, the bed sheets were yellow, filthy, and clearly never changed. We had to go stay in a completely different hotel because it was so gross. Beyond that, we haven’t been able to use it at all. Not once. 
                                    More | Being an Exploria owner isn’t what it used to be. I have been an owner for 25 years and for the first 20, I was happy. However, that all took a turn for the worse, when I was heavily pressured to upgrade in 2018. I am retired, in my 60’s and on a fixed income and this new upgrade has decimated my finances. In 2018, I was on vacation when they roped me into an “owner update” to receive a parking pass. During the presentation, they said a lot has changed since I initially bought, however, the salespeople quickly started talking about upgrades and said that now their new or upgraded owners are investing in real estate, could start to rent out the timeshare to the public, and were able to cover the cost of ownership with these programs. I decided to go for it, but later found that there was misleading or missing information that was critical to making this decision. 
                                    More | Exploria Resorts bait and switch methodology must be called out! Consumers should be fully aware of what they “pitch” is lies. We were told that this product had: fixed maintenance fee costs associated with them, which is a lie, there has been a 23% increase. Open availability at the resort(s) of our choosing, another lie, we have had ZERO “luck” at finding any availability that fits our schedule. Discounts, discounts, discounts – sure if you simply used a standard booking engine like Expedia or Airbnb. The fees and interest rates associated with “ownership” are astronomical comparatively.
                                    More | The timeshare has been a screwed up mess from the beginning, with a mix up of a studio versus one bedroom unit. Then comes the bankruptcy and losing our choices of places to go and the new company not honoring the original contract that we purchased. They tried to force us to pay another $6,000 for something we did not want. The alternative to this was having limited times and places to go. Now, the maintenance fees continue to rise. We would benefit greatly if we did not have this timeshare, being we would be able to take a vacation where we want for the same or less amount of money than we are paying in maintenance fees each year. We are so limited in the places we can go with the timeshare. We don’t have any desire to try and use the timeshare anymore. Many other vacation alternatives would be much better than this timeshare, so we want it to be canceled. | Exploria has been nothing but a thorn in our side and anything other than helpful since we bought the timeshare. We’re going on four years of “ownership” and have been completely unable to use it. When we call we just get sent through the endless call transfers. At first, we were in Orlando and they told us we were getting 30,000 points biannually and had us schedule a weekend at our home spot to “learn more about the timeshare and property”. This 90-minute presentation was FIVE HOURS LONG with our son. We tried to leave several times and they had the gall to tell us no we couldn’t leave, even after telling them no and we weren’t interested. This was like an interrogation to get a false confession, except instead of signing a statement they had us sign our lives away.
                                    More | To be clear, regardless of how our story started, we believe now that Club Exploria and Exploria Resorts, engaged in deeply deceptive sales practices, developed to steal money from young families like ours. Club Exploria invited us to stay at their property in Daytona Beach, Florida, with a required presentation. When we checked in, we found the accommodations to be right in line with “free”. Given that there was no obligation to purchase, we were pleasantly surprised, and the kids settled in. 
                                    More | Exploria Resorts is completely dishonest in practically all its business practices. Their sales team is shameful, blatantly lying during their sales presentations. We made the mistake of giving them our trust, now we are seemingly trapped in an expensive, worthless timeshare. We were told a plethora of lies that equate to outright fraud. Part of the pressure comes with comments like it is “Today Only Pricing” or “you would be crazy if you didn’t buy today”.

Westin Vacation Club,"We have a September 2023 reservation at Westin Kaanapili North on Maui. We are concerned about the fires and how that will affect our reservation. Called customer service 3 times and waited an hour on each call with no response. Sent them an email and got a boilerplate response saying that due to high volume of inquiries they were unable to respond. Called the resort repeatedly and got line busy. Called the agent from whom we bought the timeshare and was told to contact customer service (tried that repeatedly - no success). Tried canceling online to see if they had removed cancellation restrictions due to the fires - they had not. The Governor of Hawaii is asking folks to stay away from west Maui until Oct 17 and Westin Vistana is totally unresponsive to the impact this is having on their customers. They don't deserve one star.
                                    More | We were very shocked to recently receive a letter from Ms. ** that said she would not listen to us any longer. This was very unprofessional. When you have customers come to your company because they were lied to, you do not deny their experience and then refuse to speak to them anymore. What company acts this way? We know what we went through by the hands of Vistana. We want out of this agreement. Not listening was one thing, openly disregarding is a whole other. We just want help! | Bait and switch sales technique that leaves people financially distraught and angry. The properties cannot be sold after buying them; you can’t even give them away. We were told its re-sale value would continue to increase (NOT TRUE). Vistana offered us to repurchase it at a price that was twenty percent of what we paid, and that would only be possible after the mortgage was paid in full. The annual maintenance fees have increased by several hundred dollars in the couple of years we've owned it. They recently added another annual “Network Membership fees” fee of $238 annually. The bottom line is that we felt swindled, and they’ve done nothing to help us get out of this chokehold contract.
                                    More | The entire way this tour and presentation came down was very misleading. While both the lady who set us up and the sales guy who gave the tour were nice enough, there was a lot of evasion of the real questions and a lot of double talk throughout. First, we were told this Vistana/Westin Vacation Club thing was absolutely not a time share, but by the time we got all the materials, it absolutely is 100% a timeshare!!!! The documents have time share written all over them. Several times throughout the meetings with these two sales people, they misrepresented the truth.
                                    More | If there is a negative star rating, I'd give the Westin Vacation Club at the Riverfront Mountain Villas in Avon, Colorado a ""negative 5 stars"". During my stay at their timeshare unit, I've purchased an ""Encore Vacation"" package for a return stay. On September 2021, I used the vacation package for the stay. After I came home, I've noticed there was a charged from the WVC to my credit card of an amount almost the cost of the vacation package which I've already paid for. I've contacted the WVC four times and demanded an explanation of such charge. Each time of my call, I was told by a representative that someone will call me back to discuss of the charge. No response.
                                    More | I was offered 6 days/5 nights at The Westin Princeville Ocean Resorts Villas, plus a “6 day Avis rental car for sightseeing, adventure, and island travel.” All for $649, with only a $199 refundable offer to accept. When I accepted, I was later told Avis car rentals were in short supply. Substitute offers were inadequate, and unattractive, so we declined, but they refused to refund my deposit. They very much use “bait and switch tactics” to get you “in the door,” but refuse to honor their offer! | Your Review: In 2017, we were contacted and offered a free stay at the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We specifically asked if this was going to be a timeshare presentation as we had previously experienced that with another company. The representative was quick to assure us that this was not the case, so we agreed to accept the “free” trip. When we arrived at the resort, we met with the staff that gave us a tour of the property and started talking to us about the opportunities that we had to own property in Maui.  
                                    More | This company only wants your money. It's too expensive and you can never get a hold of customer service. Been trying to call for days to get a hold of someone to change over my points. Recording says over an hour wait, try again....but this is the only thing you can do and it never changes. There are deadlines and you can't call to get anyone to help. The worst money ever spent is on this vacation club. If they can't answer the phones then they should make it to where you can do it online. And even the online chat says they cant help me at this time because I have to call in. Ridiculous!!!! | We have owned at Westin Kaanapali Ocean Villas in Maui since 2013. We have since added units in the Virgin Islands and at Nanea in Maui. Suffice it to say we would not have added units if we were unhappy with our experience. People seem to love or hate their time share; there is little middle ground. The key is to know what you are buying. We first bought Westin Maui because we love the location and value the brand. Our initial purchase was pre-Vistana. We were nervous/concerned about the ownership change. It has not been perfect but has largely smoothed out. We added Nanea since the change.
                                    More | From the beginning, this has been an exercise in deceit.

They also misrepresent their affiliation with Marriott - you do not have access to those properties.  They are kept separate. They neglect to tell you they charge you additional fees for housekeeping, and I get dinged an extra $40 with every stay on top of the maintenance fees - by the way, there's no housekeeping during the pandemic, yet they still charge the fee.

Please stay clear of this company and I only wish I had done my homework and found this out before falling for this scam...How do they get away with this? And looking at these reviews, they've been doing this for a while. | I signed up with company in December of 2020. I sent them $2000.00. I could just as easily set that money on fire for the good it did me to be with these people. They did bring me 2-3 offers in the last 10 months. Ridiculous offer from people that want to pay almost nothing for great accommodations. In March I spoke with their ""Jeremiah"" who came up with ideas to place my points in their system. He did not advise it could be done by sending even more money with them. Then I tried to reach him back via e-mail 3 times and he never returned contact.

Trust me it's ALL **. | Like most elderly owners the time had come in our lives to let go of our timeshare due to health and medical reasons. So when Timeshare by Owner approached us about selling, we thought it would be the logical thing to do. They talked a good game and I was completely taken in by the southern charm of my sales lady. The asking upfront cost was more than I could afford but by the end of the pitch we had reached an agreeable amount. Based on her pitch, we should sell quickly because of the low amount I was asking. However, after 7 months...nothing. No offers. At that point I decided that I had been scammed.

She does not deserve to be talking to people who have spent an abundant amount of money to purchase time share with the company that pays her salary. In addition to her rude reaction, HGVC has become more and more of a ripoff. There is never availability when you want it, they make you jump through hoops to get a reservation, and then they cancel it without an offer to reschedule anything. That company has become too big for what they offer. They are very expensive for what you get in return. I would not recommend HGVC to anyone that is thinking of a timeshare. Keep shopping before you sign on the dotted line. | This company makes all kinds of promises it never delivers on. They use a low amount to lure you in, and once they have you, do nothing.

The receptionist was flustered and acted like he didn't know what to tell me.

We ran out of money and can no longer afford to pay unnecessary bills such as the timeshare. We told Shell many times over the years this didn’t suit us, it wasn’t anything like we were proposed it would be, and that we just don’t need this. For us, it is a headache and doesn’t work with our life. We were beyond thrilled last year when we were told our account was being canceled. 
                                    More | My husband and I purchased two timeshares from Shell Vacations Club which Shell has now sold to Wyndham Vacations Club. Wyndham has now informed us that unless we purchase into their program we can only go use the properties that we bought at. That is not the terms of the purchase agreement that we signed with Shell Vacations Club. It was that we purchased so many points and we could use it at Shell Vacations Club properties. We should not have to go into another debt in order to able to use what we already paid for. Now they want us to continue paying dues for only two properties when we were supposed to be able have access to at minimum 20-30 properties. We both feel that they have now broke the contract and are not upholding to their part of the deal, but want us to keep paying our monthly dues to maintain their properties. | Have been trying to negotiate arrears with maintenance fees. There is no negotiating! While being not current, loss of points banked and paid for. Can’t exit program until current. If I get current just to qualify to get out of this messy terrible “timeshare” I will still lose. Just the worst feeling of paying for nothing in return. | Shell vacations is one of the most SCANDALOUS companies I have ever been involved with. Do not waste your time and your hard earned money. Shell held me in a “short” presentation for over 2 hours. I am a physician and made it very known that I wanted to be able to travel to Nepal for medical mission work. They assured me I could do it using points but you need an astronomical amount of points to travel to Nepal. I attended another presentation that they told me was a “owner update” and they told me, ""Oh this isn't right. The last person probably didn't know what they were doing!"" Well it feels like nobody at Shell knows what they are doing and it's costing me money! I’d much rather use that money to pay towards the medical mission trips to help those less fortunate than the greedy people at Shell Vacations. | Wyndham is full of scam artists. Don’t fall for their lies. I have been completely disappointed by Wyndham, their product, and staff. We were lied to from day 1 in our presentation. The sales reps were pushy and gave us false information to trick us in to buying a timeshare. When we said we wanted to vacation near Universal Studios, our salesman said we’d be able to get discounted park tickets as owners, but that never happened. My husband and I REPEATEDLY told them we could not afford to purchase the timeshare but that did not stop them! All they did was offer smaller packages with lower prices no matter how many times we said that my husband was not currently employed.
                                    More | We were SVC members for about 15 years. In the beginning we really enjoyed it, but once Wyndham came into the picture, things changed. In 2016, during our membership update, we were told that we could join Wyndham now or stay an SVC member forever. We decided to join Wyndham at that point. To join Wyndham, we had to buy more points. At our membership update in 2019, we asked why we could not make any Wyndham reservations. The Shell/Wyndham person working with us said they were more like ""Side door members of Wyndham."" Yes that is a quote. If we wanted to be able to use our Wyndham membership, we would have to upgrade our membership by buying more points.
                                    More | BEWARE! If you are thinking of buying into a timeshare at Inn at the Opera, please think twice. Once they have you they disappear out of the picture leaving you holding the bag. We owned a week at the Inn at the Opera for many years. We are getting on in age and do not travel much anymore so we decided to deed it back to Shell Vacations (now also known as Wyndham Vacation Resorts). The transaction was completed in March 2020. When we received the annual property tax bill from the City of San Francisco, we sent it to Wyndham/Shell to accepted ownership of the property. Apparently, they ignored it.

Westgate Reservations,"We paid money to sell both our timeshares and never got a bite! They talk a great sales talk but there is no follow-up and no service when you call to inquire about your listing(s). I wound up selling on another site by myself. When I asked about my money back they stated that there was no refund, which was supposedly stated when we signed up. If your listing doesn't sell in a year you have to pay to relist it! Save yourself time and money and do NOT associate with this company. I really wish I would have read the reviews before making any decisions. This company should be reported to the Better Business Bureau!!! | I posted earlier but I cannot find it listed now. Do not fall for this timeshare sales company, they take your $$ and list it on a site that is only looked at by other timeshare sellers. So you will get a lot of call from these companies asking for $$ as well. Absolute waste of your $$ here. | They say they advertise your timeshare but they do nothing. I paid them $400 dollars for nothing. Their agent never returned my messages after I made payment. They do put a ad advertising your timeshare but it's just a scam. Ad means nothing at all. | Just another so called timeshare resale company wanting upfront money to put a cookie cutter ad on their website claiming that it will sell your timeshare. DO NOT BE SCAMMED!! You will not only be out the money you paid for the useless timeshare but you will also be out the fee you pay these imposters to post a tiny ad you can make yourself. | I would suggest that you run as fast as you can away from this company. I agree with all the negative comments and wished I had looked them up. I remember asking about the Better Business Bureau rating and I was told it was excellent....The company is not listed with the BBB. All they did was take my money and ""create"" an ad....used stock footage of my timeshare place....and put it on their website. No offers. Also received one phone call from them suggesting I reduce my price in order to be more attractive. Before I signed up I was told that I had a very desirable timeshare. This is a very honest company in my opinion.
                                    More | I also reached out to BuyATimeShare.com to sell, rid me of a timeshare mistake. This was the second company I used and wasted money on. There was no mention of placing my money in escrow, pending a sale. The only time I hear from them is when I file a complaint, they never put anything in writing other than the contract. The response to an email is a call only, always the same ""canned"" answer. It cost me $1,500.00. In the meantime, the resort ""Vacation Village in the Berkshire"" are asking for the fees due. I have since filed complaints, and reached out to a lawyer. Do not waste your money on this firm. I'm sure their response to this will be the same as the others noted. | I listed my Marriott Vacation Club Ownership at Kauai Lagoons with Buyatimeshare.com over a year ago. Just like over 90% of the total reviews on this web page, I rate them a 1 minus. Before I urge you to read about my experience, which literally mirrors the negative experience of the majority of the people who have been bilked by this phony outfit, please take my living example and run, don’t walk, away from this company. When you read all the reviews, take careful note of how very similar each rating of 1 is. Ask yourself why would you want to add your experience on another terrible review? They are a scam out to tell and promise you anything to get your $1,000 [like I paid] and then do nothing only to have you complain and then they recite the same lame excuses as you will read in all of the reviews, including mine.
                                    More | My first contact with this company was about two years ago. Since then Quincy **, the salesman at BMT, wouldn't leave me alone. Once you answer his call he has the capacity to talk and talk and talk, never letting you get a word in. Many people have paid 300$, 500$, 1200$ and even 1500$. He told me the rate is 4000$ but I could have a 50% discount, (wonderful- not) so it would only cost me 2000$. I think he makes up what he wants to charge and that makes me think that he is almost a one-man-band. You cannot find any sales examples on their website. There are no prices listed and if you ask what they charge, using the chat on their website, you get a refusal and told they must speak to you by phone. What's more, is the ""pay upfront"" line. That's a big clue to a scam. Get their money then do nothing. As I said you cannot find any sales examples on their website. 
                                    More | Had one person in a year that offered me $3.00 for my timeshare! Don't waste your money with these people. They don't guide you at all. Your timeshare is worth nothing. All they want is your $1000.00 bucks. Timeshare business sucks. Your investment is worth nothing at the end. | We paid this company $1500 to sell our timeshare. It is now 9 months later. They did absolutely nothing. No contact from them. No prospective buyers. No nothing. We contacted them to get our money back. You guessed it. They are backtracking away from any refund. Awaiting to hear from them. I am not holding my breath. We did finally sell the timeshare by means of having Marriott handle the sale. I think we were taken advantage of by a crooked company. David ** Maine",1.0 out of 5

My granddaughter could not even crawl on floor cause she looked like she had black oil on her after. In the new world of COVID cleanliness should be very important! Then to top it off I had to do a tour and was physically assaulted by Marc ** whom is supposedly a supervisor. He stated “he knew what I was there for.” I did not even want to tour as I would never stay somewhere like this ever again. I am a registered nurse, and was treated like I was a dirtbag looking for a handout. I reported Mr. **’s behavior immediately and considered pressing charges. I still have received no response from Capital vacations or monster vacations regarding this matter. | I am an owner and have been trying to reach someone in owner services for the last week. I have been given 10 different phone numbers and have left at least that many messages. Their loans department doesn't seem to exist. All I am doing is trying to give them money to pay off my loan. So I don't understand the runaround. Aside from a man named Glenn who works right at the resort that took my number and called me back with a direct number within 10 minutes for owner services nobody seems to have a clue what is going on. I got through to owner services as he said I would (thank you Glenn). Now I am back to getting people giving me phone numbers. | The carpet was filthy and had broken glass on it. The room smelled and they did not have any spray. I had to go out to buy my own. STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. I had to leave early because it was what it was. VERY UNPLEASANT! | Please BEWARE and do not buy into their sales tactics.. All lies.. We are trying to get out... Fees continue to go up.. They are not as nice as they portray when there is an issue.. Very money oriented.. Members do not even get access to the amenities without having to pay more money.. We were also told that they were in the middle of renovations, in which they were at that time, that was 3-4 years ago and the premises are still not very clean.. We were told too many lies to write in this review.. PLEASE BEWARE.. Wish we had invested somewhere else.. | We owned a timeshare for many years at Calypso Cay. The first few years were OK, then they started throwing in extra charges with the maintenance fees and one year it was over 1,000$. They make changes and do things without telling you. We were able to get out by doing a buy out of our contract. We had to make several calls to get the right person, but once you do it's easy. Make one final payment and get the documents they send notarized and done. We received the message today that we no longer have any financial obligations to them or any affiliate!! We will Never do a time share again!!! | We bought into the timeshare years ago. They hound you at the sales presentation. It says 90 minutes for the presentation. They keep you there for 4 plus hours. They lie and use intimidating tactics. We had Interval and then we're forced to change to RCI. Of course at a cost to the owners. They need to be sued and shut down for shady business practices. | Would be a 0 if there was an option. We were actually this place out. Upon Arrival (2am) we found out that there were no shuttles and had to walk in the rain and dragging our suitcases. To which the manager said wasn't his problem. When we got to the room. We found empty water bottles in there that were not ours, our bed was being held up buy some wooden blocks, furniture was so scratched up and missing handles, found out their ""fitness center"" is actually in the Holiday Inn Express, both in to phones did not work, hot water would run out so we could not take back to back showers (4 of us). Mind you all of this because we had to walk in the rain. I called them right away at 2am to which was told to call back after 7am because he was the only one there. 
                                    More | We just purchased at Ascendant Holidays in Orlando... At first we were skeptical because it's at Calypso Cay and we did not want to buy a timeshare but this is actually a new program that is powered by Carnival Cruise Line and is not a timeshare. We were able to buy into RCI points and we got the same amount of points as my sister who bought at Marriott except we didn't have to pay a ton like she did. We just booked our first week in Key West and it was super easy and I used my points. I still have a ton of points left! No maintenance fees either! So far so good! Give them a chance if you want to try something different! | HORRIBLE!! I am sad to say I have to write this review as a owner of over 10 years. If there was a way to give negative stars I would! Customer service desk was beyond being poor. I have audio clips of being hung up on twice when I asked to speak to a manager and when I asked who I could ask for when I called back. One of the units was filthy...pics of the knees of my 10 month old grandson after spending a few minutes crawling on the floor. Lost/found/lost reservations. The biggest thing is the TOTAL DISREGARD for ANY customer service from all but 3 people I spoke to... Esther, took my complaint, but no one returned any calls. Nate and Jasmine both listened and assured me someone would contact me prior to check out but again nothing. I personally left 3 voicemails to no avail. | Went for New Years 2018 best purchase I could have made. I went to the villa to potentially look for a timeshare for my family. We were fully informed of all the fees, taxes and deposits before arrival. My family was treated like family and other than an early tour, we were given a private tour and rep no pressure just kept it to the numbers and facts. Our villa room was fine but not as nice as the phase 1 building we purchased in but we were informed of what we were getting ahead of time. We didn't get free tickets or perks that way but, that's not why we went. Our 2 bedroom was clean but a little noisy. Our timeshare room is much better. Great deeded property and 8 weeks biannual is ok with us. And having 5000+ other properties to choose from worldwide doesnt hurt.",1.0 out of 5
Calypso Cay Resorts,"So Spinnaker Resorts called asking if we would come down and do a timeshare tour. They promised us 3 free vacations, which is an absolute lie because they use ** and you have to pay a deposit. We sat thru this ** and then sat through more ** while we continued to tell them we were not interested. Finally after 4 hours we were allowed to leave. They gave us our free vacation vouchers which I went online and registered. They said nothing about paying deposits nor did they inform us that their third party company was a complete joke and would not be able to accommodate our requests even though we followed every guideline they set out. If you get a call from Spinnaker hang up and run. | Heard their ad on tv and made the unfortunate call to them. They assured me they could sell my timeshare right away. It has been over 10 years. They have not contacted me with the exception of one time. Basically, they wanted me to give my timeshare away. I did not sell. I do wish I had because I am stuck with maintenance fees of something I don't really use. NO they will not REFUND your money. All they do is put your timeshare on their website and take your money. Run as far away and as quickly as you can from this company. SCAM SCAM SCAM. | After owning our timeshare for several years my wife and I decided to sell it. Timeshares Only had plenty of ""Claims"" for being the best and #1 so we contacted them to sell our timeshare. After being assured that we would have a quick sell because we listed ours for half of the going value per Timeshares Only, we still have not had even one offer come our way. Now it has been 6 years and still not one offer. I went onto the site to see how it was being advertised and unless you know exactly where and what you are looking for (which no one does when searching) you can't find my ad. I think Timeshares Only simply takes your money with a load of misleading talk, places an ad and waits to see if someone happens to stumble across it.

THEY ARE TOTAL RIP OFFS!! Do not ever do any business with them. I was charged 499$ for NOTHING!!! | My experience with Timeshares Only was fabulous. I’d recommend them. | I paid $598 to Timeshareonly in 2007 to rent or sell my timeshare. It is now 2015 and I have not received one phone call from this company. I called them in 2009 to check how the rental or sale was progressing to no avail. I called them again this year 2015 and was told the price was pitched too high. I reduced the sale price and asked why I had not had any communication in such a long period of time. Needless to say I got sales talk with no substance. I was told my timeshare would reflect the change in price within two days. I subsequently went online to check. When I entered my reference number there was no such listing on their database. Can someone please tell me what rights do we have in regard to this company? Reading all the other reviews it is very clear to see the majority of people are not satisfied with the service or lack of service provided. | There’s one lady who's there who seems to be effective and friendly. Apart from that, the whole process does not meet expectations. | I believe we have been with your company since 2003 or 2005, you have helped to rent our property 2 times in that amount of time.

We would REALLY love to sell our vacation club/timeshare and just be done with it. | We listed with Timeshares Only to sell and then eventually rent out our unit and they didn't require to pay a fee upfront. We had a good interaction with their sales rep, they didn't have that much activity on people looking to buy and we did rent to them a time or two. The marketing team on the other end were very efficient and accommodating. They took the work out of it for us and we got a fair price considering what timeshares sell for now. | We talked to Holiday Inn Vacation Club, which we really wanted to do the timeshare with, and they referred me to Timeshares Only. So we came down there, and all the people involved have all been wonderful. However, after about a week or two that this was going on, I got a letter from Holiday Inn Vacation Club that they were going to take my timeshare.

Timeshares Only,"When attending the Manhattan Food and Wine Festival when we were approached by Manhattan Club reps offering us a free visit if we were attended a 30-minute presentation, they assured us there would be no obligation to make a purchase. This could not be further from the truth! We were in that meeting for over 6 hours and only gave in and made a purchase because it was the only way they would let us leave. They told us that this was a real estate investment that would save us money on future vacations and that we could always sell it if we wanted. None of this was true. We have not received any tax benefits from this purchase, we cannot resell it or rent it out, and the cost continues to increase astronomically. We have tried to reach out to their staff to get our questions answered or resolve our issues, but their customer service is appalling.

The maintenance fees have increased over 173% and there is no end in sight! This is a lot of money, especially when there is never any availability. Recently, my wife had a stroke, which has impacted our ability to travel. However, Manhattan Club has been completely unwilling to help us. We have since learned that there is no value to this purchase and our biggest fear is that our children will inherit this burden and be obligated to continue these payments. This company is unbelievable! Do not believe anything they say. | I’ve owned since 2001 and things worked well for several years until they continued to oversell the shares and then sold more rooms on a nightly basis to online customers. I don’t have much to add to the numerous stories about TMC except that I finally refused to pay the maintenance fee a few years ago when I couldn’t book a room. They have harassed me consistently but I just told them I’ve contacted the NYS Attorney General’s office and they haven’t been too serious in their threats to foreclose. Recently, they contacted me to decide the situation and they’ve offered me $100 to return the deed to them. I’ve been researching on the web to see if there is a better option but it seems everything is still questionable.

Two of our family members have mold allergies. A few minutes in the first room they offered us resulted in a sinus headache for one person and a stuffy nose for another. The room smelled of mold, cigarettes and air freshener. We apologized that we couldn't stay there and asked to cancel the reservation. They sent us to two other rooms...schlepping our luggage at 10pm. Both of the alternate rooms had the same smell: a cocktail of mold, cigarettes, and air-freshener. The alternate rooms seemed worse than the first. By the time we made it through all three rooms our sinus symptoms were worse, and my daughter was in tears.

No rooms available, but finding that someone could call in from outside the owner's club and rent a room at a fraction of the cost that our maintenance fees are.

I woke the next morning with an incredible headache and the smell of mold in my room. As I was having a cup of coffee I was looking up at one of the HVAC ducts in my room and noticed black dots all over it. Upon closer examination it was revealed to be black mold. I went in the bedroom and check the Ducts there and it was the same thing. Covered in black mold. I open the HVAC cabinet on the wall and noted that the air filter probably hasn't been changed in over a year based on how thick the dust and dirt was on it. I could pull it off like I was peeling a carpet away. I checked out as fast as possible and upon visiting my doctor the next day I had a respiratory infection which required antibiotics to treat.

Our contract allowed us to either stay at The Manhattan Club for a week each year or to receive 184,500 points to deposit with RCI. After we signed the contract, the salesperson changed the contract by checking a ""points only"" box on the contract. When we picked up our contract the next morning, it was on a CD and we could only access it when we got home and it was too late to cancel it. When we called to book a week at The Manhattan Club, we were told that we had a points only contract and could only book by paying extra fees and booking through RCI. We stopped paying maintenance fees because we were defrauded. The New York Attorney General found the owners guilty of fraud in 2017.

But eventually like so many others we were unable to get reservations for days wanted. Maintenance fees increased to over 2k annually and late fees and charges made it almost impossible to stay afloat, not to mention the failing health of my partner which made it difficult to even travel like we had in the past. With the Manhattan Club in litigation, do we still have to pay maintenance fees when we continue to be scammed? Now I hear that there is lead in the paint in many of the rooms and you can only stay on certain floors. I wonder if this has contribute to my partners failing health. | We have owned our timeshare since about 2000, but have never been able to book a room there when we needed it. We have had to join RCI to use time elsewhere. Our fees have become exorbitant, but we can't get out - just like all the other complaints seen here. Is there a class action suit?

We had a great time and the restaurants and events in the area was awesome. The value was pretty good. I thought it could had been cheaper but all well great experience for my family but could had been cheaper. | I just love them complete from every angle possible. As a customer I just think they are the greatest. Love them forever. Their booking service is wonderful. I will keep using this service of theirs as a loyal customer forever. They are located everywhere near my home. They are the best ever. This is very very very terrific value for everything you get as a loyal customer. I think real thumbs up. | Booking services is exceptionally great. Every time I have called, someone really nice answers and makes my booking experience great. Additional fees can be killer if you don't know what you are paying for. Usually the additional fees are listed on your bill. There a few convenient locations that are nearby my house that I use. Also, you can go to the website of you need additional help. The value is pretty great and whatnot. Usually when I use this company, I save a lot of money and I get great deals and coupons. | The booking services were very good. I found myself very satisfied. They were great, but it could've been a little bit better to me, but I was overall satisfied. The pay was worth it - somewhat in a way I was kinda hoping it wasn't that high though. The locations offered a lot for me to see and do. I wouldn't be bored or tired from the things I saw. It was excellent though and I recommend it. The value was also something that was very nice to me in my opinion so I'd recommend it the others to come check this place out and see it for themselves. | The booking experience was very simple and quick. The entire process was very easy to understand and everyone that I talked to was very friendly and understanding. I do not recall having any additional fees added to my timeshare. All fees were disclosed to me before I had to pay anything. There were no surprise fees. I was provided with a wide variety of available locations that were ideal for me and allowed to choose the one that best suited my needs. My stay was well worth the price and I would gladly pay the same price again for the same experience if it was offered to me because it was all nicely cared for.",
Blue Bay Club,"We purchased a Charter in 2004. The maintenance fees started out around #350 a year or so. Since then the fees have gone up to approximately $800 a year. I have always paid this through Paypal. All of a sudden this year they changed how they charge you. It said NOTHING about fees if you did the payment plan. Also now a charge of $5 bucks for paper billing. They changed the website in April 2021 to list the new rules. I started my payments in January 2021 and now I got hit with $70 bucks in charges and $10 bucks for statements. I tried to call and spoke to Stephanie. VERY, VERY, VERY rude. I asked to speak with her supervisor, was told she was not in. Spoke to her boss's boss (so she told me) Sherri. Just as bad as Stephanie. Asked to speak to the person that handles the website... Not available. Asked to speak to Leeanna (Stephanie's boss). Not available.
                                    More | We have been members for over 10 years, we enjoy LVL every chance we get. There are bad reviews but those people don't or (must not) know how much it cost to camp elsewhere with way less amenities. I have 2 kids in their 30's they grew up tent camping in State Parks. My daughter does not want to go to them anymore saying I have spoiled her with Lost Valley. It is a wonderful place for us and our friends, camp as much as we want for a low price of under $900 a year! | We went and visited Lost Valley in Feb 2019, I kept telling them no to purchasing, they push and push and push and make you think that you're getting this great deal and payments aren't hardly anything. Come to find out the payments are double what I thought we agreed on, told me that we didn't have to pay maintenance fees and then I start getting bills for fees, plus payments. Tried to get out of it. Wouldn't happen, was told that I need to learn how to pay my bills. So, now it's hit my credit report even after they were to send me papers to redo the payments and take a lower amount if we didn't use the resort. No papers yet and 50 phone calls from them tormenting me. Whatever you do DO NOT get a timeshare at this place. It's run down and they lie. No wonder they are giving away so much to try and get people there. They are good I will give them that, because I didn't want to buy and yet I still did. Don't fall for it. | I was active duty Army when I was sucked-in to buying this timeshare. I was a resident of New York temporarily attending a military school at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. The closest we have been stationed to Missouri since has been San Antonio, Texas; most of my time was overseas. We have always paid our yearly fees until a few years ago when in the process of moving, we didn't receive our notification of our yearly fees. IMMEDIATELY, our fees and penalties were sent to a collection agency. 
                                    More | This is true extortion. And extortion is illegal. I'm pursuing a look into a class action lawsuit for mismanagement of funds and not delivering on the model that they promised to the membership. We've been members since 1997 and the maintenance fees have climbed to ridiculous amounts over the years. There was a time when this membership had a monetary value.
                                    More | My husband & I have been owners since 2005. The dues may have gone up the last 2 years, but the pool was leaking and the sewer system needs to be updated. I want those things to be fixed. This will just better the resort. Lost Valley is my happy place! The staff have always been great! | I am very disappointed in reference to the dues going up so much this past year then being told it would drop so I paid then find out it dropped from 600 to 509. Not much of a drop. Been a member since 1990. Since then the place has gone downhill. I could have sold mine but I would not recommend this place to anyone at this time. I offered to give it back with a quick claim deed but they said no. 
                                    More | LVL is one of the most disgusting places I've ever been. I've owned this membership for many years. There was a time when we enjoyed the facility, but those days are long gone. I never want to stay there again. The trailers are gross, infested with bugs, dirty and run down. We could not even use the shower or bathroom in our trailer. We had to use the facilities at the camp grounds, which were not much better. I tried to give this membership away a few years ago. They made it almost impossible and my potential taker lost interest saying it was not worth the hassle or money. I am going to contact LVL first thing tomorrow to see what steps must be taken to dissolve this contract I have with them. If anyone has been successful at getting rid of their membership/ownership, please let me know how you did it. I want out of this membership. | I don't even know where to start with this review but let me tell you this resort is a pure rip off!!! I've been a ""so called owner"" of nothing since 1985 and effective April 2017, I just paid a fortune to rid myself of the biggest financial fiasco that I have and will ever make in my life! You can get rid of homes, cars and for the most part spouses but you are stuck with this dump and extortion run business for the rest of your life? I don't think so! I officially bought my way out of this BS for a fortune but I can be rid of this foolishness and BS forever more now and it is worth every penny to be done with the ever rising maintenance fees that isn't being put back into the resort! Good riddance of this so called resort which is a true dump with run down RVs that are dirty with roaches and bedbugs!
                                    More | Me and my daughter and grandkids stayed for a week and the staff was very helpful and there's so much for the grandkids to do. We played games, putt golf, volleyball, watched movies, played on playground, swam, fished. It was a wonderful weekend. If I could I would give them 10 stars.",
