Atlantis Resort,1,"Jan. 3, 2022","There was no deadbolt or latch lock, no refrigerator, no, hooks for hanging towels, no shower door so the bathroom door was warped so you could not completely open it, the fan in the bathroom was always on and so loud you couldn't talk, the shower pressure was equal to power washing your house, no clock, room was dated. For the price it was a complete rip off."
Atlantis Resort,5,"April 12, 2021",We arrived earlier than expected and they actually gave us a deal on another room until our check in time the next day. Their buffet was wonderful and you had access to other casinos without leaving the building. If I go back I would stay in the same place again.
Atlantis Resort,2,"Jan. 3, 2020","Extremely impressed with hotel security who portered me in a wheelchair when needed. Room was extremely noisy due to food court in open area where music was being played. Only one single, very small garbage can. Had to flush toilet multiple times to get the paper down and even then it hardly worked. Could not turn off fan in the bathroom. Light and fan need to be on separate switches."
Atlantis Resort,1,"Nov. 14, 2019","Why, with all of these ongoing ripoffs, is this hovel being allowed to blatantly RIPoff innocent consumers. All of these things (and more) happened to us last weekend (11/8-11/10), our first and last trip to this den of thieves and crooks, and that was the Luxor joint! We didn't even make it to the strip! (At least 200 yards to the elevator!) What kind of place is Las Vegas to allow ongoing ripoff by this (and probably more) joints? I would welcome contact from fellow victims as there could be enough for class action relief against this monster. Do not, under any circumstances, trust this dirty, nasty, ripoff joint with your money! The only thing that stays in Vegas is your wasted money."
Atlantis Resort,1,"Nov. 4, 2019","Room was booked online approximately 1.5 months in advance of planned stay. Online it states, ""Your reservation deposit is refundable if cancelled before Nov 15, 2019 12:00 AM in the hotel's local time."" Today is November 3, 2019, and Lisa **, a supervisor with ""Room Reservations"" customer service is claiming the room is nonrefundable and is refusing to cancel the reservation without forfeiting the charges."
Atlantis Resort,1,"Oct. 13, 2019","The room was not clean, the building is falling apart. We paid a lot of money for amenities but wifi hardly worked, the big pool and pool area was closed, the fitness room was full of equipment that was broken. No coffee. The staff is not friendly at all. They were very rude. I feel very cheated, they don't care and you're not getting your money back. Don't go there!"
Atlantis Resort,1,"May 2, 2019","I am completely upset about my stay at the Luxor. 1) We checked into our room and it has 2 dirty socks on the floor from a previous occupant. 2) I was playing a slot machine Wonder Tower 4 Boost. I hit the Super Boost Bonus and then the machine froze!!!! When the service Tech showed up they could not fix it so I could not continue. They offered me $60 - ridiculous!!! I was at the Park MGM and hit $1200 on same bonus the night prior so I know the machine can hit. 3) Next night I was 1 spin into a Wonder 4 Tower Slot Machine, had won $135 on the 1st spin and then, once again the machine froze!!! I feel very cheated."
Atlantis Resort,1,"April 29, 2019","Bad Management, windows in remodeled room (more money) couldn’t see out of, pool closed at 6pm (didn’t get to room until 5pm), elevators old and doors shake, hallway carpets old, charges for parking, paid over $200 for one night, tram old, tram escalators out of order, ETC. Needs FULL remodel and management changes."
Atlantis Resort,1,"Feb. 20, 2019","This hotel is the worst... They charge you a $39 resort fee and the fitness center is only open to use until 6pm where all other hotels fitness centers are open until 8-10pm (when there for a convention you won't have access after you wrap up your working day) and the pool is ""seasonal"" so once again access to ""resort amenities"" is NOT an option due to their own restrictions. Room service is also severely restricted to a handful of menu options. The rooms don't have minibars or fridges. "
Atlantis Resort,2,"Dec. 31, 2018",Room rates are decent and the room we had was large but very old. IF YOU DRINK COFFEE DON'T STAY HERE! They only have 1 room type that offers coffee pots and those rooms are so small we couldn't use it. They can't bring a machine to the room so you have to go to Starbucks or pay about $25 for room service to bring it. Ridiculous! Casino is small and machines don't pay.

Sandals Resorts,1,"May 2, 2019","I am completely upset about my stay at the Luxor. 1) We checked into our room and it has 2 dirty socks on the floor from a previous occupant. 2) I was playing a slot machine Wonder Tower 4 Boost.

I was at the Park MGM and hit $1200 on same bonus the night prior so I know the machine can hit. 3) Next night I was 1 spin into a Wonder 4 Tower Slot Machine, had won $135 on the 1st spin and then, once again the machine froze!!!

I was at the Park MGM and hit $1200 on same bonus the night prior so I know the machine can hit. 3) Next night I was 1 spin into a Wonder 4 Tower Slot Machine, had won $135 on the 1st spin and then, once again the machine froze!!!

Starwood Hotels & Resorts,1,"May 2, 2019","I am completely upset about my stay at the Luxor. 1) We checked into our room and it has 2 dirty socks on the floor from a previous occupant. 2) I was playing a slot machine Wonder Tower 4 Boost. I hit the Super Boost Bonus and then the machine froze!!!! When the service Tech showed up they could not fix it so I could not continue. They offered me $60 - ridiculous!!! I was at the Park MGM and hit $1200 on same bonus the night prior so I know the machine can hit. 3) Next night I was 1 spin into a Wonder 4 Tower Slot Machine, had won $135 on the 1st spin and then, once again the machine froze!!!
