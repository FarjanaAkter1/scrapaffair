Westin,1,"April 19, 2022",My partner and I have planned to stay at Westin Anaheim for a couple of nights. The receptionist has charged the stay for 2 nights $1600 instead of $556. The math calculation was adding up additional charges that were never made. This business is absolutely a scam! You shall not trust them with your booking.
Westin,1,"March 17, 2021","My husband and I were on vacation in 2018 when we were offered a sunset cruise in exchange for attending a tour of the Westin Nanea Ocean Villas. We believed that this was part of the Westin hotel family, so we agreed to attend. From the beginning of the tour, we were continuously told that this was NOT a timeshare, but that we would be making an investment. We were told that this was vacation ownership was real estate and could easily be resold at any time we desired. Their staff led us to believe that this was something we would be able to pass down to our child, and if at any time we no longer were interested in being owners, they would buy it back. "
Westin,1,"Dec. 31, 2020","Tried booking a final romantic night in Cozumel with the Westin Cozumel and it was incorrectly booked for Nov 19th rather than Dec 19th. Tried contacting the business multiple times to remedy the situation and they said “sorry, nothing we can do”. Took over $400 and gave me nothing in return. I will never stay at a Westin again and will be sharing my experience with friends and family. Buyer Beware!"
Westin,1,"June 6, 2020","I booked three nights for End September/beginning October 2020 in this hotel using the booking portal Ebookers in order to stay there before and after a cruise to the Caribbean starting in New York. As the cruise line cancelled all cruises with this ship until Mid October 2020, our cruise and flights to New York were cancelled. Through the Ebookers portal I wrote almost 2 months ago in order to ask for a refund or a voucher to stay there at another time as we plan to book a similar journey next year. However, we never heard something from this hotel."
Westin,5,"Oct. 20, 2019","I booked 3 nights in advance to visit my daughter but unfortunately, my 4-month son had emergency surgery 10 days before our travel. We had to cancel our trip because we were in the hospital. I called from the hospital after he was stable and talked to the customer service person and I informed her about our problem and asked to cancel and refund the over $ 500 dollars that I paid. She said they don't have a cancelation or refund and there is nothing she can do. I asked her to review the phone call and ensure that no one mentioned this to me when I booked and paid all this amount. She promised me to do so and someone will get in touch with me to solve this matter. I told her if they can't refund my money at least they can give me an option to keep that amount for a future stay. I stay at The Westin for work and Marriot hotels often in different states for my business and I never had a problem before this branch in Pittsburgh."
Westin,1,"March 29, 2019","That was not true, the furniture in the room was really damage, they accepted BIG DOGS in the rooms. I see with my eyes 2 GOLDEN RETRIEVER. They offer the turn down every night I was there from 23 to 25 of March 2019 and never came to do. I have a breakfast. I request the price of the buffet but they never said they will charge 18% service. They advertising like a LUXURY 4 DIAMOND HOTEL and that's not true."
Westin,1,"Nov. 3, 2018","My experience with Orbitz and The Westin were unimaginable! My brother died 2 days before our trip to Vegas and Orbitz nor The Westin would refund our rooms even though I canceled two days prior to our stay the day my brother died! They didn’t even refund my brother’s room???. I sent over his death certificate and everything and they offered no recompense at all. Just told us that our rooms were non-refundable and that the death of the actual person staying wouldn’t qualify for a refund! I was completely surprised at how dismissive they were. I expected more from The Westin and Orbitz. Even if they didn’t want to refund us for all three rooms booked, a hotel credit would have been a nice gesture or refund my brother’s room at least since he definitely couldn’t use the room because he passed! I will never book through Orbitz again or stay at any Westin because of this incident!"
Westin,1,"Sept. 4, 2018",Lazy staff and taking a lunch break when a big line of customers waiting. He admitted and laughed about it and his manager was either dead or just plain dumb or last week on the job. Real sad. Going back to another smaller but efficient hotel chain.
Westin,1,"Sept. 3, 2018",I made a reservation at Westin in Huntsville AL and canceled my reservation within 24 hours. I still was charged for a full stay. The billing agent Nicole was awful to work with. I would never stay at a Westin or afflicted establishment based on her rudeness alone. Never received an email cancellation notice and of course they said there was no record of my call to call.
Westin,1,"Aug. 8, 2018","This Westin Resort Fort Lauderdale charged my credit card twice for a room I had prepaid for before even arriving. According to reviews on Booking.com this facility DOUBLES CHARGES PPLS CC’s OFTEN. I called and spoke with Xavier the GM for about 30 minutes and he assured me he would be refunding the two erroneous charges. Needless to say I ended up disputing it with my bank, as he never kept his promise, and my bank has placed it back on my statement 2 months later. I call the resort to see wtf is going on and I speak with Xavier who says HE HAS NEVER SPOKEN TO ME AND HAS NO KNOWLEDGE OF OUR CONVERSATION even after I gave him details about our conversation such as the fact he told me he had recently purchased a house with his wife??? The man tells me he is not a homeowner and has no wife. Meanwhile I’m looking at the notes I made in my phone from when he and I spoke."
