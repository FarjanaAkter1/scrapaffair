OneTravel,"Very polite, answer all my questions, friendly, excellent customer service. I strongly recommend One Travel to all family and friends. And the best is get in touch with the me to make sure I have everything that I need, for my next trip One Travel is main choice. Thank you very.",
OneTravel,The service was excellent but I have not received the booking confirmation to my email. Please assist. I want to print in order to have a hard copy to take to the airport. How long will it take to have my booking confirmation number by email? I will cancel my payment for the book because your system is complicated.,
OneTravel,Feedback already submitted twice.- Overall the service was very satisfactory and the platform user friendly however the pricing variance was deceptive. Thought I was paying the advertising rate of $2500 but was charged $3500. Disappointed but will know better next time.,
OneTravel,"Planning and booking my vacations with OneTravel has always been a pleasure. The different travel options presented when searching for flights has made planning a trip easy. My experience has also made me recommend this option to my friends. I also love the options for booking hotel and transportation and the prices are great. Compared to other travel sites I have used in the past, One Travel has been the best so far.",
OneTravel,"I needed to fly to and from my home state for an unexpectedly quick flight to handle a delivery in my home state and was able to do it in a few minutes. I was able to book for the next day and return within the week. I got desirable seats and departure and arrival times are satisfactory. The seats are practical for me, and I have flown with this airline before.",
OneTravel,"Support from ONE TRAVEL, via AURICk, was truly fab. Patient, persistent, all the good things and I was able to complete my order. SPIRIT on the other hand was THE WORST AIRLINE I have ever dealt with (and I have lived and traveled all over the world). You almost have to pay for the oxygen in the cabin. Their website was poorly designed and difficult to use. I don't know why One Travel supports them.",
OneTravel,I thank you one travel for your help and understanding. I really liked your service it's the second time I use this and I loved it a lot. Congratulations. Just one thing if you can add Spanish to customer service it's I was in Vancouver for a long time and I really like to go back and use OneTravel again.,
OneTravel,I think you did a good job. Your website worked well for me. One of your people just called and I am typing this as we speak. He did a good job. He made sure that all my seats were aisle seats. Thank you. Have a nice day and thanks for everything.,
OneTravel,"The ease of use was great but in the end the flight wasn’t the cheapest because of the bag fees and the seat selection fees both ways, not to mention if you would like priority boarding. A $213.81 fee plus $45 each way for a carry on, seats start at $9 each way and priority boarding cost $12 for each flight. So with all this it comes to 345.81. So is it really the cheapest???? Not.",
OneTravel,"It was easy to search a country that I want to go and fast too, I definitely will recommend to my friend or a coworker search on this website. Thank you for a good service and a thumb up, one I was confused about Hahn Air, it doesn’t show, how many kilometers for carries bag",
OneTravel,"I love my experience but I didn’t like the late flight I was given. I would rather prefer a flight that lands earlier. Like I said, the price is very good. But I would rather had a flight that lands around 2 to 3 pm so that I can use the time to do something else.",
Jetsetter,"JetSetter was referred to me by a friend, and I can honestly say the company delivered from start to finish. I was given the task of planning a group vacation, I simply provided our groups desired travel destination, date, and price range. JetSetter presented us with several options to choose from, and was in timely communication from beginning to end. JetSetter as our travel consultant was a huge relief, provided reminders of necessary documents needed, and updated safety tips. Our vacation was most memorable, and I personally have thanked my friend several time over for her recommendation to try JetSetter.",
Jetsetter,Went to their presentation at a large hotel! Signed up and next day we cancelled. Contract says within 3 days cancel to get full refund! They ignore our cancellation and refuse to refund our money. I filed with BBB. They will not respond. I am filing with Attorney General and then will obtain an attorney! NEVER USE THIS SO CALLED COMPANY!,
Jetsetter,"Purchased membership and package to include 6 nights at a Marriott and upgraded Hawaii vacation. The ""gifts"" for attending the presentation turned out to be pretty much worthless (fees and small print restrictions). Almost impossible to contact our agent to schedule Marriott, Hawaii, etc. Lines are always busy, voice messages not returned, or line no longer in service. This happened with two different agents. After countless attempts we were finally able to get a discounted Marriott room in Kansas for 1 night. For approximately $2600 that is the TOTAL BENEFITS to date. Additionally I purchased and airline ticket through them. The flight was cancelled and they refunded the money to Jetsetters 5 months ago. Despite persistent attempts they have not refunded the money to me. Have sent them registered letters which were not acknowledge. Filed a complaint through the BBB and they did not respond to them either. We feel completely ripped off.",
Jetsetter,"We were promised a free airline trip, $500 for food and if we were 15 minutes early, $50. Those gifts were promised just for listening to the presentation. We did purchase membership, but had to cancel due to a family emergency. WE GOT NOTHING!!",
Jetsetter,"I had never heard of this company until Amazon sold them my email address. I hit ""unsubscribe,"" only to be told I had to register for an account to unsubscribe. This is not an honest way to do business, so I will not be involved with them in any way in the future. (Shame on Amazon as well, by the way.)",
Jetsetter,The overall flight booking experience with them was outstanding! Booking my flight was very easy and the company gave outstanding customer service to ensure that I got the flight that I wanted. They have great customer support and great rates and I highly recommend them. It was very fast easy and reliable and the service was fantastic! The procedures to book your flight will be very easy to understand. The overall cost was very affordable and the company has very competitive prices compared to others on the market! The outstanding customer service that you get will far outweigh the costs involved! They are just an exceptional company to deal with.,
Jetsetter,The booking service met my needs in searching for travel location. It helped me get the best deals for everything. Everything explained to me was very informative and straight to the point. The website was easy to use. It wasn't hard to navigate through all the travels posts. The filter was good at organizing things and for me being able to find things easily. The price tag is predictable with the price being higher end to the other stores that are similar in products. There are so many. With a higher price it is able to put more into service. There is extra service if you need help on finding something or if you have any question. The extra service offers different forms of communications.,
Jetsetter,They are easy to book when I need to. I have nothing but great things to say about them and what they do and continue to do for me and my needs to travel. They are very easy to use and are always there when I need them. They have the best choices and prices and packages. Great cost on everything. They always make sure to let you know that they have new extras all the time.,
Jetsetter,"The booking services was great. It doesn't take a lot of time to use the booking services, since all you have to do is pick the options you wants and provide the results. It is easy to use because all you have to do is select what you want and set up the preferences and everything will provided as a recommendation. I love that it has no cost for this service. It is free so we can use it whenever we want without worrying about if we will get charged if we don't use it. The extra services are amazing because there are many other services that offer, so you don't have to use it just for booking purposes.",
Jetsetter,I was able to book my vacation with little ease. There were many hotels and airlines to select from. They were very courteous when I called to ask a few questions. I was very satisfied with my experience. Jetsetter is a great website to use. It's pretty easy to navigate throughout the website and find what you're looking for. You just put the dates that you need and you will get a full list of available results. The cost was a pretty great value. They have some of the lowest prices around in the business. I was able to save over 200 dollars on my last trip using Jetsetter. They are a great company. Some of the extra services are really great. You can look up flights and book an airline that you need to use at a very low price. They are very easy to use and this website is one of the best.,
CheapOair,Working with this site has been very easy. I needed to contact an agent with some clarifications and to add our frequent flyer numbers and Global Entry IDs. She was very helpful and patient. She alleviated the potential for stress and just took care of it all then sent the new information to us via email. Her name was Kim. Lovely experience.,
CheapOair,When can I check in for my flight on 6/22 at 12:49 leaving CVG landing in Atl? I have checked my inbox for early check in and I have gone online to the Frontier Airlines site to check in but could not use the reservation number I was given when I completed the booking.,
CheapOair,"The process was easy and so far no problems. However, I have not received the boarding pass and I was not told how long it will take. I am to keep checking email? And there is also a possibility that I may not get my boarding pass?",
CheapOair,"Jigs was outstanding helping me resolve issues with my flight details, and provided excellent support and explanations. Although originally frustrated with CheapOAir, he managed to renew my confidence in the company. For a time it appeared that dealing directly with the carrier would provide cheaper rates without unnecessary markups. That is all I want to say, but your form keeps asking me to add words... so I am getting frustrated with CheapOair again.",
CheapOair,"Hello, Nagel was nice and very helpful. The only thing is he talked a little bit faster. Sometimes I have to tell him to repeat what he said to me but other than that he is really great, polite and he ensure that I understand everything. He also stayed on the phone until I get my booking. Confirmation for my mom....Keep up the great work Mr. Nagel. He also told me to call him whenever I need to book a flight and he is willing to help me with any inquiries. Keep up the great work Mr. Nagel.",
CheapOair,"I see on the Hotel Price Details that there is a entry for $2223.44 and it should be $1110.46. Stella may have gone over this with me, but not sure. My head is still spinning from all the info. I do have a sheet that says there was a cancellation for something...don't have it at hand and I would be reimbursed. Can you tell me what that was for? My total is $3,691.61 which is about $1,000 or more over what it should be. Does that have something to do with a cancellation of something..the room??? Oh, on the review that I left before this one... NO. I have not received any incentive for doing that one. Thank you.",
CheapOair,"A true nightmare beyond believe!! Hello All. Am not sure about others' experiences. My experiences with CHEAPOAIR is beyond terrible. This information is just the beginning of me telling the world how bad they are. Am a single mom, a dentist, lives in San Diego CA. I bought tickets to visit my dad in Jakarta Indonesia who was in bad condition for June 16th, 2023. Flying from LAX to Cengkareng International Indonesia. Coming back from Bali - Denpasar to LAX on July 2nd,2023.More",
CheapOair,"Very easy to book the flight ticket, the website easy to followed, the prices very reasonable and competitive, after you book the flight ticket, they will send you the confirmation about the booking for you to review, I would refer this website to my friends, and to the one I know or around me. Very helpful, help times and money",
CheapOair,"Paid for my tickets, thought I was done, WRONG! Now I get to pay for my one carry on bag $74. I am a senior citizen on a very fixed income. This sucks sewer water. I'm so disappointed in this kind of behavior.",
CheapOair,"I truly enjoy CheapOair because it allows me to plan my family vacations all on budget plan. For example, I'm disability retirement and I really can't afford to travel but a family friend told me about cheapoair and I really couldn't believe the savings and discounts. Thank you so much for assisting me.",
CheapOair,"The site kept wanting to refresh which in turn raised the flight cost. Which ended up costing me $435.00 instead of the price that I first saw on the site which was $421.00. Also, the trip protection jumped in price as well every time it wanted to refresh. My take on this is that it is just a way for the 3rd party companies to make money off of the airline's customers.",
CheapTickets,"Cheaptickets customer service, name change team, informed me that they simply needed a copy of the marriage certificate and a copy or photo of my wife and daughter’s passports to submit a request to change their names on the itinerary to be consistent with their passports. Over a period of three days and several follow up phone calls, I was told each time that it’s being worked on and would take only 2-3 hours. Which took nearly three. It still didn’t happen. The name change team said that they can’t change the name, but must cancel the current booking (which is non refundable of course) and purchase new tickets at the current price. Because cheap tickets didn’t change the and wanted more money, they have now trapped my wife and daughter in China, unable to come home. My daughter will have to be withdrawn from starting kindergarten.",
CheapTickets,"I would rate my experience with CheapTickets website as extremely poor. On July 3rd, 2023, I purchased two tickets for a flight from Amman, Jordan to Toronto, Canada with a layover in Vienna and Paris. However, upon arriving in Amman, my wife and I were informed by Austrian Airlines staff that she was not allowed to transit through two European countries with her Yemeni passport.More",
CheapTickets,"I had reserved and paid for 2 round trip tickets to cancun, which I misspelled my last name on the ticket, Cheap Tickets gave me the runaround for weeks telling me to call the airline it was booked through. Eventually I had to buy new tickets from Alaska airlines because cheap tickets said it was impossible to fix my last name!! Took a very big loss and so upset that they weren't able to fix my name. None of the employees there actually know what they are talking about. One time on the phone the guy said he fixed it, don't worry about it, which was ridiculous because if it were that easy then why didn't they do it before and I never received a confirmation email. So he hung up and again I had to call again and get a different explanation how they can fix it. Then they told me to wait till 48-72 hours before the flight and the airline would be able to switch it. HAHAHA right because if I did that and it wasn't possible the ticket would be an insane amount of money. Worst experience ever!!",
CheapTickets,"I bought a round trip ticket coming from Costa Rica for my elderly mother, unfortunately she suffered an accident and broke her hip before the flight, I presented Cheaptickets the Doctor's letter about the accident of my mother and to request the refund or credit, they had me back and forward for about 22 days before the flight promising me will be resolved, the day of my mother flight came and they did not resolved anything. At the end they started sending me robotics messages that I had to to resolve it with Avianca the airline.",
CheapTickets,"Do NOT use this company!! They do not research or keep up with the motels/hotels they book for you. The place was literally a drug addict prostitute motel. The pool was filled in with dirt and the glass to the front door was tapped together. As a single woman, I did not feel safe and they did NOTHING to help.",
CheapTickets,"I booked an economy United Airlines flight through CheapTickets in July 2021 with the intent to fly in August 2021. My family ended up having an emergency that required me to stay home instead of travel as planned, so I called and spoke with a cheaptickets representative over the phone that eventually (and begrudgingly, after trying desperately to talk me out of a credit) supplied me with a credit to be used for a UA economy flight between that date and 12/31/23.More",
CheapTickets,"When you get a credit for flight cancelation, and want to use it for next flight, you are required to contact them to book. They then charge you double!! To ""cover"" the return. You are not allowed to book yourself online... and.. the flight you find online for cheaper they tell you we ""Don't get them on our screen,"" SCAM!!!",
CheapTickets,Cheaptickets advertises hotels that they do not check. The Super 8 in Burleson Texas is not as advertised. It was a dump for local prostitutes. I sat in the chair all night and refused to use their bathroom. The manager refused to answer my calls or the calls of CheapTickets. Cheaptickets refused to refund me the 5 of the 6 days that I did not stay in this dump. They have a no refund policy for no shows but no policy for checking out early. They should listen to their customers and at least offer a credit for future travel. DO NOT USE CHEAPTICKETS!!!,
CheapTickets,"After flying to an international country this site tells me there is nothing they can do when there are plenty of flights left with other airlines that they can easily book me on. Also NEVER buy their Insurance Policy, it's the biggest scam because they will not refund your money. They'll find a way not to refund it. My recommendation is to make sure you book directly with the airlines and avoid these deceiving companies at all costs if you are flying internationally. Moreover, they outsource their customer service to outside the USA and the service is just horrible. If you want to save yourself a lot of money, book elsewhere. They pretend to give you a deal and then cancel your ticket, so you end up paying twice if you want to reach your destinations on time. AVOID this site at all costs.",
CheapTickets,"Had a flight booked to Philippines. I was waiting on my Visa to get into Philippines. It did not come in time. So went to cancel my flight one day before. But they stated the ticket was with the airlines already. I called them to cancel, and they did. After I verified it was canceled the airlines stated I can go back to CheapTickets to rebook. Talked to Cheaptickets. They can not see on ""Their System"" that it was canceled. But they could say that they could charge me a missed flight fee, and additional $400+ with no problem.More",
trivago,I went on Trivago to search for a hotel in New York City for 2 nights and found one for the Marriott Marquis. Trivago took me to a booking site called ALGOTELS and they charged me $660 for the two nights. A few days ago I called the hotel to ask a question and was told that they didn't have my reservation so I have been in contact with both Trivago and Algotels and have gotten nothing but a runaround from both. I have left it up to my credit card company to get info and they did a credit to my account as they look into the issue.,
trivago,"Don't be fooled, I lost almost 2,500.00 dollars because I made a reservation on a page that Trivago advertised and it was a fraudulent company and TRIVAGO said that they were not responsible for the theft. On the other hand, something similar happened to me with KAYAK and they did take responsibility for a fraud from another company that they advertised and they returned all my money!!! I don't know why TRIVAGO keeps advertising hotel sites if they know that many of the companies they advertise are scams and thieves, do they also receive some commission for fraud? Otherwise because they keep announcing hotels etc. etc. KAYAK, PRICELINE OR BOOKING are very good, trustworthy and responsible.",
trivago,Booked two rooms at the Disney All Sports through Trivago then third party site Agoda it put in dates for my stay but as I looked after I paid the dates were wrong. By then I couldn't get a refund or credit for different days so I'm out $450.00 dollars. The site is very deceiving. I feel scammed. They could at least changed the day.,
trivago,"We booked the Royal York in Toronto via the Trivago site through a third party supplier named Traveluro. We received a voucher with a confirmation number. On the day of travel by air from Halifax, NS to Toronto we were advised that our reservation at the Royal York was cancelled because it was overbooked. We then phoned the Royal York and they advised that they were not overbooked and did have many rooms left and did not recognize our confirmation number. We then contacted Traveluro. We then contacted Traveluro who then again stated that there were no room available at the Royal York but offered us a room at a three star hotel called The Beverley. We reluctantly accepted this reservation because we were out of options.More",
trivago,They propose you prices which are always without taxes for hotels in EU which have taxes included. They propose good deals but later they cancel your reservations. Those deals keep appearing on their search results but you can’t have them! Complete waste of time. Go to Hotels.com and you’ll always get 1 for free after 10 stays! Simple and more efficient.,
trivago,"I booked online using the app in Canada for a hotel in Ontario, Canada. I agreed to paying $129.16 Canadian. And I got charged $129.16 in USD so my bill came to $168. I've talked to three different agents and nobody can help me in resolving this issue. I will not be using Trivago again and will be sharing this information with friends and family as well.",
trivago,I used Trivago.com to find a hotel to stay at. Me and my wife were taking a trip to Miami for a concert so we use trivago and it hooked us up with **. That’s not a typo. It’s called **. We booked the room and ended up having to cancel it because Covid hit so I called the hotel to cancel our reservations and they said we had to contact Otel. That in itself was a nightmare. When we finally got them to do something all they would do was give us a voucher for a stay in another hotel at some other time.More,
trivago,Site is on top of new rules and price changes. I love this site and would recommend it so go try this out for yourself. That's the only way you will know and all I can say about it right now cheaper flights.,
trivago,In my travels we booked as we went & found by choosing between the first three you looked. Always have a brilliant result; Not only were we satisfied with the ease of booking but felt confident that nothing was going to wrong with our decision making as price was always exactly what we expected!,
trivago,"Trivago is the best site I've seen to find the ideal hotel to stay at. I highly recommend using it. And then when you find the hotel you want to stay at, the best thing to do is go to that hotel's website and book directly through them. You will pay the same price and the hotel appreciates you booking directly through them so they don't have to pay a fee to the middleman. Sometimes they will will thank you by giving you a free drink or some other freebie. Also when you book directly with the hotel it is more likely that you will actually get the room that you request. You will also probably have an easier time changing or cancelling the reservation if necessary. I hope this helps.",
TripAdvisor,"We recently registered our business with Tripadvisor with a number of agreements to include Tripadvisor wiping reviews from another similar business at our location (different business name). A new account should have been set up instead of adding our business to an old businesses account. We requested that reviews of the previous business be wiped, as well as requested that dated pictures of the property and pictures that were not of the property be deleted. Tripadvisor didn't follow through on any of the agreed terms and went silent after our account was set up and billing was established. The account manager stopped answering his phone and there is no phone number for a general customer service for property members.More",
TripAdvisor,"Several times now I try to book a hotel with a ""special price"" for Tripadvisor Plus members. I keep getting error messages about my credit card info not entered correctly - I have meticulously entered credit card info for 3 different cards, all of them in very good standing. I sign out and sign back in and, of course, then the ""special price"" is gone. It's impossible that this is just coincidence that it has happened at least 3 times.",
TripAdvisor,DO NOT prepay ANY hotel through Tripadvisor. They do not visit hotels before they upload the hotel. When you arrive at hotel it's not as the pictures & then you are out of luck for getting a refund. Tripadvisor does not get hold of the manager for the approval of a refund and they just deny it saying they couldn't get hold of the manager. Always check the hotel and room before you actually pay the hotel.More,
TripAdvisor,"They reject reviews without any solid reason. As such, the reviews on their site cannot be trusted. Customer reviews are all important, even when they are negative. Customers deserve to read all reviews.",
TripAdvisor,The whole thing is fake. Tripadvisor ONLY promotes restaurants or hotels that will book though Viator and pay a 30% fee. All the other legit companies will not be rated. That all started about 5 year ago when Viator bought Tripadvisor. I'm in the top 3 in my area but you cannot find me there as I refuse to pay that 30% booking fee.,
TripAdvisor,"I wish to inform all businesses that are thinking of signing up with Tripadvisor, that you read and understand their policies. They are very strict about not removing any reviews from their website even if they are detrimental to your business. They won't even let me close my account to remove my listing. I can only say that my business is closed. All the reviews will remain online forever. As long as the reviewer seems to be within their so-called guidelines, they will let it be posted. Please look elsewhere for review companies that allow some sort review management. I have over 36 reviews on Tripadvisor. Two of them are negative and over 5 years old. If you do I search for my business on Google, the most negative review always, I mean always shows up first in a search. No rotation of reviews whatsoever. Here is the canned response I received from the so-called support team:More",
TripAdvisor,"I made a booking for a Hilton hotel 6 months before my reservation. 5 days before my reservation they sent me an email that said I can cancel or go to a different hotel that was outside of the city. I called 3x getting different stories, but the email was true. I’m TripAdvisor plus. I pay $99/yr for good deals. This is not acceptable. I can’t trust them now so I will never use them again. They were no help when I called. Take the hotel or cancel basically is what they said. I cancelled. What if I had been going on my dream vacation. Think about this before you book with them. Will you be ok if you get this email 5 days before your trip. I have always liked Tripadvisor, but now I know what happens when things go wrong.",
TripAdvisor,We are abandoning TripAdvisor as our guide. Often we find ourselves in restaurants with bland food that have high ratings just because of the price and because just like with everything else the general public has a sad taste.,
TripAdvisor,"They want to only hear positive. But that helps no one traveling to warn them about potential problems and rip-offs and dangers. People need the raw unfiltered truth, not some namby-pamby review that does nothing to aid them in their choices.",
TripAdvisor,"As a service business our reviews are very important to us. We strive to offer the highest level of customer service and respond to any unsatisfied customers immediately. Posts that are ""blatantly"" mistaken identity or obviously non verified customers do not get removed when you report them to TripAdvisor. We took valuable time to investigate the authenticity to a few negative posts and TripAdvisor still refused to take them down. Their platform is not fair like Google and Yelp reporting. They actually ""read"" your report and ""see"" the issues. Honest posts regardless of the review are not disputed and we attempt ""every remedy"" available to ensure the customers are satisfied with our actions when dissatisfied. Their platform needs better monitoring and oversight with more in depth rational considerations when businesses dispute a review.",
Travelzoo,"I am so very disappointed in my recent experience with UTOvacation. I have been a Travelzoo member for many years, and always had great experiences with your Top 20 vacation deals. My experience with UTO was very different. Same as previous posts regarding the advertisement of UTO vacations. UTO changed the submission date, and then said the tour was booked in full even though I said I could be very flexible on dates. Now I am out 4k. UTO is offering my family a travel credit, but as I read more about the company this is just another bait and switch to get more money out of you, to again cancel with the offer of a credit. After doing research I see this is not an isolated case, and many families have lost thousands to this company, and by extension Travelzoo is benefiting from the traffic to their site. Travelzoo continues to advertise this company's deals even after the abundance of burned customers.",
Travelzoo,"Echo the same problems from the last few reviews - we need to make this more prominent and tell people. Travelzoo needs to stop endorsing companies that operate fraudulently. I also booked a trip from UTO Vacations but UTO did follow their own Terms and Conditions. They changed the ""submission of forms"" dates requirement after we had paid them in FULL. They have cancelled and rebooked us three times, each time asking for more money., I thought eventually it would happen, but now two years later they just cancelled again. Then they cancelled us and refused to refund the monies paid. Travelzoo continues to endorse them too. I'm not alone as I heard stories from others of the same incident. And I am posting so that Travelzoo remove them from the site asap!",

They changed the ""submission of forms"" dates requirement after we had paid them in FULL. Then they claim we didn't submit on time. All these documents are supposed to be submitted 150 days before our trip starts but they changed the dates demanding we submit 250 days before, thereby making us lose 3 months of compiling our documents. They also just gave our group 10 days to complete everything? How is that specially with trying to get our passports (which was in the pipeline) at the moment? Then they cancelled us and refused to refund the monies paid. Travelzoo continues to endorse them too. I'm not alone as I heard stories from others of the same incident.",
Travelzoo,"I put down a deposit for couple of trips with UTO. They cancelled my China/India order(#**) for more than a year ahead of the scheduled?? The trip is not depart until OCTOBER 15, 2023. UTO transfer my money from that order to another booking without my authorization. I try to contact UTO by phone and emails with no success. After 7 months and a 1 star review on their website, Amy ** calls, offer no explain, refuse a refund and ask if I would like to reinstate the trip now. If they did that from the start I would get into their trap, to pay final payments + mandatory tip (UTO charge $30 tipping a day pp, outrageous) and would have loose more money.More",
Travelzoo,TZ advertises tours for UTO Vacations who fraudulently cancels or changes scheduled trips. They give you the option for a refund then never refund your money if you select that option. Beware of UTO via TZ. TZ should refer replicable companies for customers!,
Travelzoo,"UTO Vacations is the name of the company, they are not listed on this website but I purchased via TravelZoo portal. BEWARE. It looked like such a good deal. We booked in Nov 2022 for a trip in Nov 2023 with UTO vacations. Per documentation (we have copies) last payment was supposed to be May 2023. One month (April) before last payment I contacted them to get status on visas process. They claimed they had sent an email in February (that email was never received) and was told that I was dropped by the list and couldn't go to the trip (I have the chat conversations). They didn't even had the courtesy to send an follow up or send email to let us know we have been dropped.More",
Travelzoo,"The Turks and Caicos' package deal my cousin & I purchased $2,299 was noted as a beachfront suite. Nowhere did it state it was only 1 bed nor that you could not upgrade to 2 beds. Resort said no to upgrading & I can get a refund from Travelzoo. Then resort came back and said for $2282 we could get a 2nd bed. That’s more than the original cost for pkg deal already paid!! We then requested a refund or at least a credit with Travelzoo of whom rejected both options. The package deal ad never stated the # of beds. If it did, we clearly would not have purchased it, as we are two grown cousins that do not need to be sharing a bed. Especially for the money paid. It almost feels discriminatory that technically the package was geared towards couples. But now we are being punished and out $2300 because Travelzoo will not at least give us a credit.",
Travelzoo,"My family of three purchased a vacation package from UTO Vacations that was advertised and supposedly vetted by Travelzoo. This was on 9/9/22. We paid in full as requested by the company ($1578). We completed all requested documentation. I started researching visa requirements only to find China was requiring a mandatory 10-day isolation at your own expense when entering the county. Our whole trip was only 10 days. UTO was aware of this requirement when they advertised and sold the travel packages. When I contacted UTO Vacation their response was, ""Sorry, you will have to take a credit and use toward a package that costs thousands more.""More",
Travelzoo,"I have booked with Travelzoo on a few occasions and have had good experiences. But this time was not so good. I booked a 2 night stay at a hotel in Tofino. The description read, room with a view of islands. So I thought it was a full view of islands as the hotel did say they had rooms like that. When I arrived at the hotel , the room had a partial view from the balcony. I phoned the front desk and they said they did not have any full view rooms left. And to contact Travelzoo. I emailed them and all they said was sorry I was disappointed with the view. And that's the room I booked. So be aware, their descriptions of the room that you are booking may not be accurate.",
Travelzoo,"BUYER BEWARE!! UTO is a scam and is not reputable, don't buy a tour with them. We purchased a tour to China through a link from Travelzoo in November 2020 and planned to travel the following year. Obviously, China and the world shut down due to covid. UTO was unable to fulfill their part of the contract so they kept a credit for future travel. China continues to be a mess and have outbreaks of covid, lockdowns, travel restrictions, etc. I have no desire to travel there. UTO has had my money, interest free, for 2 1/2 years and they are refusing to refund my $1300. Their customer service agents tell me to use the credit toward another of their trips rather than a refund. UTO is unable to produce the trip to China, they need to refund my money. Why does Travelzoo continue to showcase such a dishonest and disreputable company like UTO?",
Tours4Fun,"We went on a two day excursion to Niagara Falls from New York. We really liked the excursions presented by the travel company, but the only thing that was not convenient for us was the bus. It was not new and it seems to me not designed for a long distance. But despite this, we were very satisfied. Our guide Judy was very friendly and happy to answer any questions. Thank you for a good vacation time.",
Tours4Fun,"I booked a trip for Niagra Falls last week for Aug. Plans changed and according to their policy ""100% refund if requested 25 days or more prior to departure ""...I submitted the request and I received an email back saying they will charge me 6%. It's impossible to offer 100% refund and still have to pay a fee.",
Tours4Fun,"We booked a 5 day / 3 island tour of Hawaii with this company. Even after paying the full price for the trip, which included pick up / drop off; hotel stay, etc. The driver / guide kept asking for tips for each instance. Pick up - Tip. Drop off - Tip. and the list goes on. When I asked why we are being harassed for tips every few hours, the Chinese speaking driver pointed to the so called 'contract' stating these tips are mandatory. When I agreed to pay only what I thought was a reasonable tip, and not their mandatory tip amount, the driver called up their office and complained against me and I received a nasty e-mail from them the very next morning berating me for failing to tip the driver. Plus, the driver / guide was Chinese speaking, and we could hardly understand her.More",
Tours4Fun,"We purchased a bus tour for 14 people from LA to Vegas, Antelope Canyon, Grand Canyon, Chocolate Factory, and Cactus Garden. The bus had issues after a stop on the way to Vegas. The next morning as we went to load up we were told our large comfortable tour bus was being repaired (never did) and the backup plan was to squeeze us plus the rest of the travelers into a car and a van for 10 hour drive.More",
Tours4Fun,The tour was like well oiled but the driver cum guide mostly spoke on his phone throughout the journey and at times he even texted while driving. When the tour can easily allow clients to see the night lighting at the falls they try to make money even out of what is otherwise free. Everything aside putting people's lives at risk not acceptable.,
Tours4Fun,"Everything was in Chinese and it was very confusing. I didn't get anything about pick up location, guide, vehicle, whatsoever. I had no idea where or what is going to happen. Even a day before the actual trip, I didn't get anything. I had to call them to find out and it was actually different location that I knew from the reservation. It was extremely difficult to communicate with them, also even though that was their fault, they refused to refund my money and I just blew hundreds in the air. I literally got no service at all but they didn't give my money back. All I wanted was going to Grand Canyon without hours of driving but eventually I had to drive 10 hours a day but still wasted my money. I super regret booking with this company and from now on I won't trust any of these scammy services AT ALL!",
Tours4Fun,"Great price! Terrible tour guide with poor English, no customer service skills, and who was very impatient. Predominate Chinese and Indian attendees. I got to see most of the places mentioned but was very rushed, stressed, and with unrealistic time frames. Left around 6:45 am and returned 10pm. Spend over 24 hours riding from NY, to NJ, to DC, to Niagara Falls. Most of the tour is spent riding a dirty bus.",
Tours4Fun,"Our tour guide is very rude. He discriminated and treated very differently to people who order adds on item with cash and who didn't order. He is very impatient and told me and my friend that if we don't order adds on item with cash, we have to stay in the bus. We only saw city hall area in Philly for the whole trip. Overall, one of the most unpleasant experience and don't want to recommend.",
Tours4Fun,"Be careful with booking any trips with this company. Unlike other companies (Viator or Get Your Guide), their cancellation fees are based on how long in advance their customers cancel their reservation in relation to their travel date. When booking trips/activities they do not inform customers in the obvious manner about their cancellation and change policy during the online reservation process. You need at least 20 days prior to booking to cancel your reservation to get your 100% refund. The cancellation process is arranged the way that customers are required to fill a long cancellation form with detailed information that is frustrating and time consuming. Everything is set up to delay the cancellation process as much as possible to catch unaware customers and surprise them with cancellation fees. The other companies provide better service and cancellations can be made up to 24 hours prior to excursions without cancellation fees with one click of a button.",
Tours4Fun,"We pre-paid for a Chichén-Itza tour from Merida. The day before, T4Fun emailed changing our pick up location from our hotel to a home address in a neighborhood blocks away.

Travelocity,"I booked a hotel reservation and selected the option to pay a down payment. However, the full amount was charged to my card. Once I received the receipt, I contacted Travelocity’s customer service, they told that’s what was charged and they don’t have control over that. I kept asking to speak with a supervisor and he put me on hold and came back on the line and said the full amount wasn’t charged. Again, I had the receipt showing the full amount was charged to my card. We contacted the hotel directly and was given a person to speak to for the full refund. I haven’t used Travelocity for quite sometime and WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!!! Awful customer service!",
Travelocity,"Booked a stay in Canada back in June. With the fires, I cancelled the trip. Travelocity refused to refund the insurance we paid for. Stating it's non refundable. I cancelled because I am afraid of my infant daughter breathing in the air. Over $71 they would not refund to me. They cared more about taking my money than a health of a baby girl. Over $71.",
Travelocity,"In June 2022, I purchased 6 first class tickets to take my family to Santa Fe for the week of March 4-11, 2023. When my son and daughter-in-law announced in late November that they were expecting their first child in May of 2023, we realized that the trip would have to be postponed until al later date. I contacted Travelocity to get a refund on my tickets which were described as fully refundable when I purchased them. I was told that in fact Travelocity will not issue a refund but instead they would issue credits to all six of the original passengers. Furthermore, as I booked the flights in June of 2022, all six of us had until June 2023 to use the tickets or lose the credit.More",
Travelocity,"Imagine spending $2100 on a flight to HI on Feb 2nd with insurance on it, but your work gets hit with ransomware the next week. You don't know your future with your job because you are down for a month, so you cancel your trip on Feb 22. Now imagine that flight wasn't supposed to be until July 21st, so you gave proper notice and even had it insured. You think, wow I believe I can get a refund after submitting proof, but no. If A happens, they only payout on B. If B happens, then they only payout on A situations. Then allow them to tell you that you can use your credit, but it's only limited, and they mark up the flights a couple of hundreds of dollars and then tell you, you can only use your credit one time. So the only trip I could take out of my way was to Miami for $1400 economy AND YOU HAD TO PAY $8 to book it. Does that make sense?More",
Travelocity,I booked a trip through Travelocity for me and my three children to go to Thailand. At the last minute one of the airlines canceled causing us to be unable to go. I could not get reimbursed by anyone because airline pointed to Travelocity and Travelocity blamed airline and refused to accept any responsibility. I had the same thing happen with a hotel on a separate trip. Hotel did not have amenities represented by Travelocity. No one would take responsibility. DON’T USE TRAVELOCITY!,
Travelocity,Flight was canceled. Never notified sent us to different destination. Offering rental car to drive the 4 hrs. (Car wasn't available when we got there). Next flight delayed. Bags lost. Never made trip. Wouldn't cancel hotel or refund anything.,
Travelocity,"This company's customer service and policies are the worst I have ever experienced from any company I have ever dealt with. When asked to modify my rental car reservation to a larger car, they told me it was not doable for a reservation I had made approximately 2 hours before. Not only were they unable to upgrade my reservation, they were insistent on keeping their $100 for a reservation that was a couple of hours old. They not only have the worst customer service but are also not truthful on whose policy this is- the rental car company or their own. When I talked to the rental car company, they stated how awful Travelocity was to work with and how unethical they were with their cancellation policies and collecting money. I would never recommend using this company for anything unless you want to be taken advantage of.",
Travelocity,"I purchased a hotel booking that was non-refundable and could not be canceled or changed. I purchased the offered Package Protection plan offered by Travelocity. Travelocity and AIG Travelguard are scamming people into buying these fake protection policies that do not cover you when you file a claim. I canceled this hotel stay and filed a claim and they pulled out a lot of fine print to deny my claim. DON'T BOOK WITH THEM AND DO NOT PURCHASE THEIR PROTECTION PLAN. IT'S A SCAM. I've sent screenshots of how the wording is misleading, they don't care. My only recourse now is to try to post these reviews and hope others do not get scammed.",
Travelocity,Travelocity switched my flight to and from my destination. I was switched to an overnight flight going so the arrival date was the same but the date leaving my destination was a whole day later and refused to switch it back. I asked for a manager and he ended up hanging up on me and the escalation team refused to help as well unless I paid 100 per person which is 500 for my group. So now I have to see if the hotel will be able to accommodate and also my rental car.,
Travelocity,"Service was nearly useless in resolving issue with a hotel. Took over two hours to get Travelocity to work with the hotel to acknowledge a reservation made weeks in advance. When finally acknowledged, the property expected another 60-90 minute wait before allowing access to the room. Travelocity was told to cancel the reservation but am still fighting with them two days later to get a refund. Travelocity agent was rude, failed to acknowledge they failed to cancel the reservation as directed, and eventually hung up.",
Orbitz,"I highly recommend not using Orbitz for any type of travel. They do the ole' bait and switch. My family purchased a trip and insurance to Florida only to have to change the city due to an emergency situation. Instead of them taking ownership and helping us. They referred us to the actual airline and the airline was charging full price, of course. Orbitz took no responsibility nor tried to help us. Even though we purchased the trip through them. I will never, ever and I do mean never use Orbitz AGAIN and recommend you (those reading this) or your family or friends not to use them either. Save your time and money, go somewhere else!!!",
Orbitz,"I booked tickets through American Airlines through Orbitz. The Orbitz website showed all the details of my upcoming trip, I received a confirmation email from the airline the day of my trip. But when I got to the airport, they told me Orbitz had canceled my ticket and refunded my bank account without notifying me in any way. I had to rebook with the airline, my trip cost $600 extra, and I had to return on a separate flight from my husband. If I had booked directly with the airline, this couldn't have happened, so I will never use Orbitz again.",
Orbitz,"I've been an Orbitz customer for over 20 years. I've booked over 100 travel reservations through them. I recently booked a car reservation for approximately 26 days in advance. Orbitz recently started offering non-cancellable CAR reservations. In very poor form and in my belief what they've done intentionally, is they only call out the noncancelable reservations in most minimal way possible. The non-cancel reservations are also interspersed with the cancellable reservations. When I booked my reservation, Orbitz charged my CC. I IMMEDIATELY contacted customer service to cancel. They informed me they would not refund my money. I escalated the call. After 53 minutes and 2 escalations, they offered a 50% refund. I accepted the 50% refund, cancelled my orbitz account, called my CC company to dispute the charge. I will NEVER book with Orbitz again.",
Orbitz,"Don't book with Orbitz! Their prices are extremely higher than the hotels and their match guarantee is not even comparable to the hotels. I booked through Orbitz for July 7-9 Room 2 double beds and sofa bed at the Hyatt in Greensboro NC for 3. They charged me $345.92 nonrefundable. As a member of Hyatt, the rate for those same two days is $288.19 and refundable up until one day before check in. What is the purpose of using Orbitz. They don't offer any discounts or bonuses for their service. I truly believe they are a ripoff. Also customer service told me Hyatt was not a place they offer price match but the reason they refused to price match is because my reservation with them is nonrefundable and Hyatt offers a refund up until the day before you check in.More",
Orbitz,"Orbitz sold an airline booking but refused an name correction on the booking once we arrived at the American Airlines ticket agent. The Orbitz agent then started an argument with American Airlines agent, lying about the policy of American Airlines. Subsequent customer service calls showed no help from Orbitz about their own inability to understand airline policy... AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS. They cannot deliver reliable aircraft bookings.",
Orbitz,"Do not use Orbitz, they blatantly lied to me about my refund. I tried canceling a trip, but on several occasions making sure with the agent, “It was refundable, correct?” They assured me it was, then days later when I realized my money wasn’t back into my account, they used their shady fine print. I had used them for years, but after the rudeness, lack of transparency, and communication, I will never use them again.",
Orbitz,"Booked a rental car for Mexico and pre-paid for the reservation. Upon arrival at airport, we had a very difficult time contacting rental car agency (10 calls over 45 minutes and they finally answered.) When we finally got through they had no record of our resv number or name. We had to go rent a car from Hertz and are out $300. When we contacted Orbitz for a refund they responded that they couldn’t reach the rental car company so they could only refund our insurance fee ‘as a courtesy’. What a scam! Orbitz has our money and just plans to keep it. Do Not Book with this site! It is a scam! I don’t understand why they haven’t been shut down.",
Orbitz,"I booked a trip to Banff from Toronto through Orbitz for my family of 4. My return flight through flair airlines got changed and now I am flying into 1 airport in Toronto and having to fly return to Kitchener Airport. That means I can't park and fly and have to make arrangements to get to and from both airports which is a huge inconvenience. I called Orbitz and asked if they could get me on any other airline to get back to Toronto from Calgary so we didn't have to fly out of a different airport. I was told no, I would have to rebook and pay full amount and nothing else could be done. I stated this was my first time with Orbitz and could I get some sort of compensation for my troubles as this is a big inconvenience. I was told no, nothing could be done. I travel a lot and will NEVER be booking with Orbitz again. Beware, this company is a sham and does not care at all about its customers!",
Orbitz,We booked a package to Mexico including transportation from airport to hotel. MTS (the transportation company) messed up and dropped us off at the wrong hotel. We contacted right away Orbitz to clear it and have them transfer us to the right hotel. They started playing the game that they gave the right information to MTS while MTS said they were given the wrong information from Orbitz. While time was passing without any help from either of them we had to take a taxi for an additional $50. Orbitz said they started the refund request and after two days the refund was declined. That is really bad business practice I. Moreover the information they gave about the hotel are completely wrong…9 restaurants - 8 bar/lounge in reality there are 4 restaurants and 3 bars. This was definitely my last time traveling with them.,
Orbitz,"Booked a package trip to Roatan through Orbitz. 4/5 thru 4/15. It was a moderate to low end hotel so our expectations were modest. Upon arrival we learned the reception desk is rarely staffed, and no one there upon afternoon arrival. There is no maid service or fresh towels/linens, TP or anything else you may need. We purchased towels and essentials from a store nearby. We saw one person at the desk twice over a 5 day period... Most days the office was locked and no one on the property.More",
Expedia,We booked a trip through Expedia. When we arrived the hotel we booked was closed for renovations. It took an hour to reach Expedia. By then we had to book somewhere else for double the price. Expedia was not concerned at all. They gave us a refund for the trip and since it was a package told us how much we were getting which was only half of the cost of the rooms we had to book somewhere else. They blamed it on the hotel which was Days Inn in Memphis Tennessee which is horrific. I tried to reach out to them by live chat and they couldn't care less about your problems. They are making reservations without checking to be sure the hotels are open. They just want your money. Do yourself a favor and do not book with them. Read all reviews of hotels. They make you think they will back you but they do not. You will be left stranded like we were.,
Expedia,"Due to a weather, our flight was canceled. We called Expedia multiple times to inform them that it was not our fault and requested that they either book us another flight, follow up on our hotel reservation, or at the very least refund our money. However, they did not provide any of these services and did not even follow up properly. Every time we called, they simply told us to call back the next day for a response from the hotel. We even offered to pay for another flight ourselves, but we have to know our room still is available or not? Or if it is not can you provide us another room? They insisted just wait.More",
Expedia,"We booked a hotel in Cancun and airport shuttle through Expedia.com for 07/23/2023. Our flight was 1 hour late getting into Cancun airport. The shuttle never appeared, “apparently” it was there before and left. We had to pay for a taxi to get to the hotel. We paid in full the shuttle service (Speedy Shuttle) through Expedia. Expedia “tried to contact” the agency in Mexico and allegedly claimed that the “agency denied the refund”. Never again will we go through EXPEDIA. Terrible customer service, we couldn't be more vulnerable.",
Expedia,"I booked a car through Expedia for 8-11-23. They gave me a rate for SIXT rental car company. Our flight with Allegiant was 2 hours late getting into Nashville.

I paid in full the car with Sixt and they denied me a refund. Expedia said sorry, they won't give you a refund. Never again will I go through EXPEDIA. THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER.",
Expedia,We booked 4 hotel rooms on Expedia. For 08/12/23. Got to the hotel and 2 of the rooms were canceled without our knowledge or them telling us anything. The price for the rooms was wrong and they required a deposit before they would rent you the room. None of this was available through the website Expedia.com. Expedia charged my card for all the rooms and refuses to give me my money back. They want to give me reward points. Called customer service and spoke to a foreign gentleman who was no help and couldn’t understand basic English. He was useless. I do not know if they are an American based company but they are Hiring the bottom of the food chain. He was about as helpful as chewing on crayons and eating glue. I would not use their company or their services if they paid me to do it. My dog could probably run a company better than this retard.,
Expedia,"I have used Expedia for years and never had to contact them before, but when I needed their help, wow, what a mess. First of all, my flight to Europe was delayed causing me to miss my connecting flight which resulted in me having to stay 24 hours in a foreign country and pay for a hotel where I was supposed to fly into and now couldn't use. Therefore, the first day and a half of our vacation we were enormously stressed and sleep deprived.More",

Expedia,They arbitrarily change your dates and leave you without a refund or a place to stay. Then they will not even speak to you about the problem. For a company with the age and standing of Expedia to resort to scamming customers is very disappointing.,
Expedia,"Theft is what my experience amounts to. Theft and incomprehensible idiocy. We were traveling home to California from Indiana via car, and taking things in a spur of the moment manner, not really knowing exactly where we’d need a hotel each night. Do each day we’d drive and then by late morning we’d see what hotels were in the area we then knew we’d be. So we’re in western Iowa on the 29th of July and decided we’d stay the night in or around kimball, South Dakota. Plenty of hotels to pick from. Found one on Expedia, and it was a pay at hotel deal. I checked the email confirmation and it said 7/30 not 7/29. Hmmm, that’s weird and not right since by 7/30 we’d be somewhere in Montana.More",
Expedia,"Booked and paid for a rental car through Expedia. Took $40 Uber to airport to pick up rental car. Instructions were to show driver's license and the card used to book car at time of pick up. Rental car company would NOT rent me the car because my card was a debit card and not a credit card with a $500 balance available. It said that their policy was to not accept debit cards for deposits. I asked for a refund and was told to call Expedia for a refund. Upon calling these criminals, I was informed that my booking was non-refundable and I would not be getting my money back.

I was definitely satisfied with all representatives. From the initial reservation call, to picking up my rental, to dropping off the car at the LaGuardia location in New York. I even went ahead and extended my rental for another day and in my drop off date. There was a shuttle bus on time at Drivo waiting to drop me off at Laguardia. Which took maybe about 5mins to get to the airport. I had a wonderful experience. No hassle, no attitudes, representatives were very friendly. All of my total charges were fair. I'll recommend Drivo to anyone and will use their services again. The next time I'm visiting New York City.",
Priceline,I would like to say thank you to the fabulously talented customer service representative I just talk to. I had to cancel a booking at the last minute and thought I would lose everything. I was in a panic and concerned about what I was going to do if I lost all the money I put into a hotel. I've been sick and had a long string of bad luck.

So I'm sending nice totally not robotic review here honestly in hopes that I stop receiving the email surveys about how great the experience was. It was great all times. A few times I had to wait for cars for an hour or more, but that was the car company's and that's not Priceline's fault. They are just the messenger.

Priceline,"I allowed Priceline to book a room for me to get a discount. I gave them my preferences, and told them what I was looking for and the area. They booked a room 15 miles from my preferred area, I didn't get a discount. I never finished with the booking, but they booked it without my knowledge. I didn't know the room had been booked, so I booked one myself. I didn't know until I looked at my bank account. I asked for oceanfront and was placed across the street from the ocean. We were on a motorcycle and the resort didn't allow motorcycles. We were gonna have to pay another 100.00 for oceanfront which is what I asked for.

Airbnb,"I have rented from Airbnb multiple times without issue. The one time I did have an issue with a property, I discovered that Airbnb is in the business of siding with the host even when there are published procedures to protect the guest. My incident involved a property that did not portray the current condition of the house. It also reeked of marijuana. After escalating my complaint, sending pictures and videos, and citing the Aircover policy that protects against inaccurate listings, Airbnb told me that the ""inaccuracies"" were ""subjective"" so there was nothing they would do the help me. It was so unsafe that I did not stay at the property and I ended up booking and paying for another property. I am having to pursue a refund by disputing the charge with my credit card company. Airbnb would rather lose customers than take action against a host.",
Airbnb,"AirBnB seems to favor host topics/issues v. guests who had to deal with horrible hosts.

Airbnb,Someone at that location had reinstated my Netflix account and was watching movies at that same location that very day. Then Discover notified me that my card number was being used to charge other things with other vendors. They had accessed the smart tv and managed to get my discover card information. I Contacted Host to find out who had rented the house and was staying there at the present time. So the police could become involved.

Airbnb,"Airbnb is scammer horrible co that should be out of business. Why are they so popular if they have 1.5 star ratings on average? I was a super host with all 5 star reviews worked hard to build that status and suddenly they disactivated my Account with barely any explanation and canceled my reservations as Not Legitimate. I am 1000% legit with STR licenses, ownership docs, ID verified, that's why they had me for years. It was heart wrenching pain as my business solely relied on income from my rentals. Customer service is non existent, all they're trained to do is BRUSH OFF, tell specialized team will reach out within 24Hrs. Over 2 days no one reached out. Terrible, Shocking Experience.More",
Airbnb,"I booked, confirmed, and paid for a home for the 2024 eclipse. It was a great deal. AirBnB canceled my reservation without explanation or a way to respond. I think the renter realized they could jack up their price for the eclipse, but they had to kick me out first. That's exactly what they did.",
Airbnb,"I was a host for this sham of a company. I have all five star ratings. A guest left me a 3 Star review as retaliation for not accommodating an early check in by 3 hours. She was able to check in a hour early as I rushed to get her room ready. The star rating was she had to wait, the place was excessively small (Tiny is in my title) filth, clutter, shared bathroom (shared bathroom is on my profile). I reported fraudulent rating. It was obvious by our messages these things were not true. Airbnb refused to take it down because guest said I was nice. Since I got a compliment the rest is valid. I have since canceled my listing and will never rent from or host for this company who cares nothing about people and did nothing to investigate this embarrassing and obviously untrue rating. They need to be shut down or revamped or something. Horrible horrible horrible.",
Airbnb,"I reserved 3 nights with AIRBNB and their host RECINTO by AM TULUM, Mexico. After paying the full amount I got the exact location. Was not convenient and I cancelled and request refund within 90 minutes. AIRBNB promises a response within 4 days. No response after 7 days. After another intent they told me in a day will be a solution. My refund was not recognized. NOT FAIR!!!",
Airbnb,"This company is fraud. They allow anyone to use your property without owner involvement and third party and Airbnb makes money. They have done fraud by using my property and I lost more than 15k where they say, ""We can’t do anything."" Be careful…. This total fraud.... Just care about their charges and fee no matter how and who is listing. They don’t have any protocol to determine whose property… Answer is that we can’t do anything… They made thousands of dollar in my property by paying third person. Airbnb did not do due diligence to verify whose property and to whom they are paying. Airbnb just want their charges no matter how it’s come..More",
Airbnb,"We had a booking for a room in Miami, but to our dismay, the room was not we expected. When you entered the house, the smell alone were noticeable. Inside the room were so dark and smells horrible too. The bed smells like an old sweat/pee that sticker to our skin even tho the host - Angel claimed it was cleaned prior to us checking in. The AC was not too strong either, been like more than an hour but the room was still hot. To top it all, we didn’t realize that the place was actually on a ** area. We’ve never been to Miami, and this was our worst experience ever.More",
